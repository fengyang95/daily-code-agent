However, traditional risk management, narrowly focused on\ntechnical tools, is structurally inadequate for systemic threats like upstream\n\"silent fixes\", community conflicts, or sudden license changes, creating a\ndangerous governance blind spot. To address this governance vacuum and enable\nthe necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,\nwe conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a\nholistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical\nframework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External\nThreat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a\ncritical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an\nundefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the\nimpact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical\nchain: \"Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation\" (OTVM). This\nprovides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.\nBased on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a \"Strategic Objectives Matrix\"\nto clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,\nEx-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and\n(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these\nvulnerabilities. The framework's analytical utility was validated by three\nindustry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.\nThis work provides a novel diagnostic lens and a systematic path for\nenterprises to shift from reactive \"firefighting\" to proactively building an\norganizational \"immune system\"."}

This paper addresses\nthe fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown\nbiases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?\nWe develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable\nsystematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the\nconcept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from\nobservable covariates.

The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity.

This paper introduces\nStuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that\nenables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or\npassenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on\nmodule that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control\nstack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it\ninterfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,\ninterpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that\ncan be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the\nBench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios.

By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces\ncomputational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments\non the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%\nfewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer\ninference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly\ntranslate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge\ndeployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic\nsystems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a\npromising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling\nefficient online learning at the edge."}

However, many real-world\napplications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --\nwhich involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document\ncollections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10\nmost cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering\nfour core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k\nextraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and\nbaselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,\nwith the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that\npreserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates\nLLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates\naggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,\nGlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,\nvalidating the effectiveness of our method."}

As AI\ncapabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying\nquality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we\ncan leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an\nimportant safety problem that is already challenging for humans:\nfact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human\nratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.\nGiving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their\naccuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,\nconfidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results\nand evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications\nfor Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to\nsupervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance."}

Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely\nadopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,\nhigh-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by\nlearning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under\ngreater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be\nunstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty\nquantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a\ndeterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature\nextractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a\nBayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for\nfine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first\nvalidated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly\noutperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of\npredicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from\ntube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the\nstaged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,\npotentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering."}

However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is\nresource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach\ninvolves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method\noften results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in\nsample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling\ntechniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet\nrepresentative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic\ndistribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF\nestimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a\ntypical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the\nmodel forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the\nremaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory\nusage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline."}

In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models\ncan provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we\ncompare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two\nmodel-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best\nforecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even\nsurpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for\nclassification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting\nand classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that\ntask-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast\nmay provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series\nfoundation models."}

Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module."}

PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty\nover linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise\nshifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that\nTransformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on\nunseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published\nclassical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up\nto $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.\nSurprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can\nbe reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented\ntogether during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying\nstructures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with\nmodulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for\nnear-perfect prediction grows as $\\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization\nenters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \\geq\n2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating\na critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding\nlayers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously\ngroups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,\nrevealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli."}
