However, best-intended practices for conducting empirical studies\nhave not yet well established. In this paper, based on the primary studies\nidentified from the latest systematic literature review on quantum optimization\nfor software engineering problems, we conducted a systematic analysis on these\nstudies from various aspects including experimental designs, hyperparameter\nsettings, case studies, baselines, tooling, and metrics. We identify key gaps\nin the current practices such as limited reporting of the number of\nrepetitions, number of shots, and inadequate consideration of noise handling,\nas well as a lack of standardized evaluation protocols such as the adoption of\nquality metrics, especially quantum-specific metrics. Based on our analysis, we\nprovide insights for designing empirical studies and highlight the need for\nmore real-world and open case studies to assess cost-effectiveness and\npractical utility of the three types of approaches: quantum-inspired, quantum,\nand hybrid. This study is intended to offer an overview of current practices\nand serve as an initial reference for designing and conducting empirical\nstudies on evaluating and comparing quantum, quantum-inspired, and hybrid\nalgorithms in solving optimization problems in software engineering."}

To address this\nchallenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with\nSemantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a\nsemantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when\nusing remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our\napproach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with\nsemantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of\nconversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are\nautomatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate,\nprivacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world\nconversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to\nassess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's\nresponse. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a\nfactor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy."}

We show that our\nMDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity better capture the\nkey differences between attested, natural systems and unattested but possible\nones, including \"optimal\" recursive numeral systems from previous work, and\nthat the ad-hoc constraints from previous literature naturally follow from\nregularity. Our approach highlights the need to incorporate regularity across\nsets of forms in studies that attempt to measure and explain optimality in\nlanguage."}

In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of\npedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised\npedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,\ntwo with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across\nbehavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined\nmodel with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints\nlead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during\ncrossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual\nuncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more\ncautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this\ndata-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning\nmodel, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training\ndatasets.

Building on this, we\npropose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates\nthe multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is\ndetected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the\nmultilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while\nusing translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates\nthat understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning\ngap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into\nits origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.\nOur code and data are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/deokhk/RLM_analysis."}

We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL).

First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning?

However, an emerging\nparadigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from\ndata so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream\ntasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call\npanprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction\ngeneralizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which\nrespectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or\nmany downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that\nlearn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with\n$\\tilde{O}(1/\\varepsilon^3)$ and $\\tilde{O}(1/\\varepsilon^2)$ samples,\nrespectively. Our results demonstrate that under mild assumptions,\nsimultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can\nbe as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Along the way, we\nimprove the best known sample complexity guarantee of deterministic\nomniprediction by a factor of $1/\\varepsilon$, and match all other known sample\ncomplexity guarantees of omniprediction and multi-group learning. Our key\ntechnical ingredient is a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to a\nstatistically efficient notion of calibration, called step calibration."}

Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for\ncross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of\nintermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces\nmemory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding\ngradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been\nevaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In\nthis paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks\nconverge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information\nadheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the\nrecently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the\nmatrix-based R\\'enyi's $\\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each\nlayer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to\nthe output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant\nrepresentations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training\nprocedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further\ndemonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign\nrecognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training\nbaselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD."}

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation."}

Previous work in this area has\nprimarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search\n(NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for\nevaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing\napproaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation\nmetrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce\nweight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored\nfor lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies:\nthe parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative\ncontribution exceeding $\\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer.\nAdditionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize\nthe evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating\nlightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and\nSQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and\nachieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous\nstate-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking\nevaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space. Our approach\nexhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared\nto other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation."}
