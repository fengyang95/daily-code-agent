This has further resulted in universities integrating\nprogramming courses into a wide range of curricula, including not only\ntechnical studies but also business and management fields of study.\n  Consequently, additional resources are needed for teaching, grading, and\ntutoring students with diverse educational backgrounds and skills. As part of\nthis, Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) have emerged, providing\nscalable and high-quality assessment systems with efficient evaluation and\ninstant feedback.

Although the\nresource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of\nproject management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader\nliterature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its\nintegration into the design and management of complex systems. The original\ncontribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the\nRCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems\nengineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT). A concrete translation\npipeline from an activity-on-node network to a SysML activity diagram, and then\nto an operand net is constructed. Using this representation, it specializes the\nhetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation to the RCPSP\ncontext as a systematic means of HFGT for quantitative analysis and proves that\nthe RCPSP is recoverable as a special case of a broader model. Secondly, on an\nillustrative instance with renewable and non-renewable operands, the\nspecialized HFNMCF, while producing similar schedules, yields explicit\nexplanations of the project states that enable richer monitoring and control.\nOverall, the framework preserves the strengths of the classical RCPSP while\naccommodating real-world constraints and enterprise-level decision processes\nencountered in large, complex megaprojects."}

The former,\nsuch as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream\ntasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational\ncapacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained\nadaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen\nsubset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and\neffective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory\nconsumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT\nmethod that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory\nefficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,\nconnections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces\nbypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the\nbypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.\nEmpirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and\nunderstanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance\nwith as little as $\\leq \\textbf{0.02}\\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing\nCUDA memory usage by up to 60%.

While the term root cause analysis or RCA has been\nwidely used, different studies formulate the task differently. This is because\nthe term \"RCA\" implicitly covers tasks with distinct underlying goals. For\ninstance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is\nfundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug for a\ndefinitive fix. However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these\ngoal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types\n(e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods). This leads to the grouping of\nworks with disparate objectives, thereby obscuring the true progress and gaps\nin the field. Meanwhile, the typical audience of an RCA survey is either laymen\nwho want to know the goals and big picture of the task or RCA researchers who\nwant to figure out past research under the same task formulation. Thus, an RCA\nsurvey that organizes the related papers according to their goals is in high\ndemand. To this end, this paper presents a goal-driven framework that\neffectively categorizes and integrates 135 papers on RCA in the context of\ncloud incident management based on their diverse goals, spanning the period\nfrom 2014 to 2025.

The extent to\nwhich such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,\ndependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,\nthe recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities\nhighly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to\nunderstanding information diffusion processes and to improving the\neffectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these\nprobabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations\nbetween peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence\nrelationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from\ninterventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or\noptimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher\ninfluence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence\nprobabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a\nfundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation\nerror, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an\nuncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains\nany pair within this trade-off.

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity.

For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems.

While recent theoretical work has studied\ntransformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the\nformal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of\nrelated tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task\nindividually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing\nthat a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act\nas a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a\nnatural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional\nGaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional\nsubspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show\nthat the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$\nin-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This\nperformance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the\nshared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access\nto the in-context data, which requires $\\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to\ngeneralize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and\nexamples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient\ndimension $d$."}

This paper examines the\ntechnical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in\nBrazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy\navailability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies\naccelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150\ndays), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,\nand regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our\nfindings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and\nelectrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by\nhardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a\ntotal cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million\nUSD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training\ntimelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,\nenabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models\nwithout competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the\ndiscourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by\nhighlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to\nestablish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities."}
