Lower resource languages fare\nworse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in\nsub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.\nThis sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by\naggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate\nthe imbalanced development of speech technology."}

We present RANGER, a repository-level code\nretrieval agent designed to address both query types, filling a gap in recent\nworks that have focused primarily on code-entity queries. We first present a\ntool that constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph of the entire repository,\ncapturing hierarchical and cross-file dependencies down to the variable level,\nand augments graph nodes with textual descriptions and embeddings to bridge the\ngap between code and natural language. RANGER then operates on this graph\nthrough a dual-stage retrieval pipeline.

We evaluate RANGER across four diverse\nbenchmarks that represent core ASE tasks including code search, question\nanswering, cross-file dependency retrieval, and repository-level code\ncompletion.

To mitigate these challenges, this paper\nintroduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism\ndesigned to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,\nstructured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and\nvalues. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve\nrelevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We\ndemonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG\nenabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is\ninspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic\nknowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint.

Modeling neural networks as maps on probability\nmeasures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,\nproving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the\ndynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,\nwe study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We\nfully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to\nbe represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,\nthese include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally\napproximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These\nproperties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part\nof their Fr\\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that\nthe solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,\nfor interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy\nproblem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be\napproximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the\nmeasure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the\ninfinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with\na Vlasov flow."}

Our framework models social interactions, where a\ndeveloper editing the code of other developers triggers accelerated activity\namong collaborators. Using a large data set on 50 major OSS communities, we\nfurther develop a method that identifies activity cascades, i.e. the\npropagation of developer activity in the underlying co-editing network. Our\nresults suggest that activity cascades are a statistically significant\nphenomenon in more than half of the studied projects. We further show that our\ninsights can be used to develop a simple yet practical churn prediction method\nthat forecasts which developers are likely to leave a project. Our work sheds\nlight on the emergent collective social dynamics in OSS communities and\nhighlights the importance of activity cascades to understand developer churn\nand retention in collaborative software projects."}

One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),\nwhich are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders\n(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an\nautoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based\nGR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling\nlaws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while\nscaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly\nsaturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization\ntokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of\nSIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.\nMotivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with\nbetter scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses\nlarge language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS).

Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space\nthat jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information\nby directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain\nfully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding\nthe inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower\ndecision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to\nbandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as\nan implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for\ncommunication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both\nvariants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team\ncoordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined\nwith existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance."}

However, these agents often exhibit\nhallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning\nmechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal\nunderstanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual\nProgramming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly\nintroducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to\ndefine a simple \"world model\" for workflow modules through an intuitive\nlow-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that\nexplicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph\nacts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring\nits decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing\nlogical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious\ncorrelations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic\nexperiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift\nbetween the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally\nanchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a\npurely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations\nexperienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this\nstudy are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the\nproposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to\na user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the\nframework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors\ncaused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path\ntoward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents."}

To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a\nnovel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex\nsocial dilemmas.

However, offering users verification of their data\nremoval post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current\nverifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to\ninfluence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely\nestablish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to\nconnect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only\nconfirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as\ngenuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a\nSelf-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification\nfor genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as\nusers' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the\nverification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for\nunlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding\nthe seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server\nrequires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a\nself-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including\nthe seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of\nthe original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a\ndelicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the\nself-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously\non the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model\nseeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through\nextensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective\nverification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations."}

However, a\npersistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across\noperating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work\ninvestigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)\nwithin a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter\nidentification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from\nthe same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related\ntasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise\ncharacteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear\nand cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under\nthree excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to\nreproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms\nwhen excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,\nthe MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for\nweakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance\nunder high excitation.

Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans\nmonitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for\nintrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).\nDuring exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error\nor novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions\nrather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design\nthat uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the\ndynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the\nmodel errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide\nexploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is\nzero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that\nthe error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We\nempirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy\nenvironments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.\nResults show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states\nin the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari.

We\nintroduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality\nchanges, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited\nacross AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI\nannotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and\nbrowser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we\nanalyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets\nincluding Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to\nanalyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our\nFeedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in\npopular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation\ndata at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics."}

In this work, we posit that this performance\ndisparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental\ndifference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes\non-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we\nintroduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides\nSFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning\nprocess by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement\nlearning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by\nsampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The\nground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward\nsignal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes\nstatic, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the\ntoken level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while\nbypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive\nexperiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical\nreasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that\nOTR consistently outperforms standard SFT.

In this\nwork, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,\na framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs\ncompression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to\nmeasure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via\na Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more\ncapacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression\nratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to\naccount for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with\ngrouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different\nscales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently\noutperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower\nperplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up\nto 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%\ncompression ratio while achieving even higher throughput."}

Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity.

While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses\non synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and\nasynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,\nand do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting\nintroduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot\nimplicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid\ncollisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the\nsystem, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges\nposed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We\ndevelop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between\nexploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their\narms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the\nfirst challenge.

We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.\nViewing each task's exploration as an \"item\" with a distinct \"value\" and\n\"cost\", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This\nformulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively\ndistributes resources based on the model's current learning status.

In this paper, we propose\nContinuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and\ndifferentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or \"N:M\")\nsparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and\nweights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,\nwhile progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.\nSpecifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware\noptimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification\nacross all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the\nmagnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;\n3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to\nenhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns\nacross multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our\nresults demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art\nmethods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training\nresources.

Additionally,\nwe establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse\nmodel performance given adequate training resources.

This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative\nmemory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal\nthat the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output\n(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary\ncontributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,\nwe then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are\nintrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less\nfrequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key\nproperties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular\nspectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes\ntail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we\ntheoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative\nmemory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently\nachieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,\nwhereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on\nembedding properties.

Since large\nlanguage models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood\nor identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and\nin turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence.

Based on 54 experiments across\ndiverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,\ndata volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our\nanalysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,\nlarger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models\ntrained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger\nmodels achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In\ndata-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly\neffective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of\noptimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples.

To address this, we propose\nthe Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level\nthinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.\nGiven a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the\nfaithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then\napplies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring\nreward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness\nevaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both\nexternal and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that\nTRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and\nincorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both\nanswer correctness and usefulness."}

By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal\nthat the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output\n(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary\ncontributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,\nwe then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are\nintrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less\nfrequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key\nproperties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular\nspectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes\ntail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we\ntheoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative\nmemory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently\nachieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,\nwhereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on\nembedding properties.

Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected\nfrom a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three\narchitectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and\na hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ\nvariables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the\nbest short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas\nCNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting\nwindows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The\ncomparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data\nresolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These\nfindings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management\nSystems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy\nconsumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations."}

Yet, some use cases, like image\ncaptioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex\nmodelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated\nnetworks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular\ninterpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,\nlightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\\texttt{tensordict}$\nand applicable to any $\\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex\ncomposed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language\nProcessing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features\nready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for\ninterventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to\nmake modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with\nminimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as\n$\\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a\n$\\times$2 speed-up over $\\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for\nmulti-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we\nshowcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability\npipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as\nwell as with complex models in DRL."}

Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only\nfar from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the\noriginal model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A\ntoy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior\nlocal minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the\npresence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as\ncorrelations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our\ntheoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural\nnetworks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in\npractice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay."}

Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable\nrewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of\nLLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward\nto supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,\nwhich limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address\nthis by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and\nencouraging grounded problem solving.

This paper presents the first systematic investigation\nchallenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a\nstatistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we\nidentify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes\nlocal semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.\nLeveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,\nplug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic\nsteps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy\nimprovement under the same throughput budget.

Yet, across 5 studies\nand ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used\nLLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive\nattributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their\ncompetitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this\nself-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models\noften lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature\nserendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between\nself-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,\nexplicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing\nLLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,\nnot true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential\nsettings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,\nsecurity software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human\nbias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result\nraises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced\nby self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation\nand even their own existence.

We release our dataset and evaluation framework to\nsupport further research in multilingual LLM evaluation."}

We introduce DeepScientist, a system\ndesigned to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous\nscientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a\nBayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical\nevaluation process consisting of \"hypothesize, verify, and analyze\". Leveraging\na cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration\nof novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising\nfindings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU\nhours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and\nexperimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing\nhuman-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by\n183.7\\%, 1.9\\%, and 7.9\\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of\nan AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific\ntasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of\nscientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will\nopen-source all experimental logs and system code at\nhttps://github.com/ResearAI/DeepScientist/."}

We address this by proposing a\ntwo-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free\ndataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using\npreference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of\nthis offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that\nintegrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret\nbounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly\nconnecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We\nvalidate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing\nit achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online\npreference-based RL.

One\npromising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it\nquantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task\ncompletion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward\nlearning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,\nincluding robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances\nbetween frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise\nproxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments\non ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically\nimproves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10\ntasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This\napproach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed\nenvironment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.\nMoreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human\nvideos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward\nsignals from diverse video sources."}

By comparing LM\nconvergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a\nfour-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a\nsharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a\nslow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge\nfaster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually\nreconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to\nlearn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token\nfrequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is\nuneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words\nconverge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens\nand content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the\nstability of the learned distributions in model training."}
