In common eye-tracking\nstudies in program comprehension, researchers must preselect analysis targets\nsuch as control flow or syntactic elements, and then develop analysis methods\nto extract appropriate metrics from the fixation for source code. Here,\nresearchers can define various levels of AOIs like words, lines, or code\nblocks, and the difference leads to different results. Moreover, the\ninterpretation of fixation for word/line can vary across the purposes of the\nanalyses. Hence, the eye-tracking analysis is a difficult task that depends on\nthe time-consuming manual work of the researchers. eye2vec represents\ncontinuous two fixations as transitions between syntactic elements using\ndistributed representations.

Yet the\neffectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and\nnoise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring\nstreams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally\nunsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in\nLLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but\nthe challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In\nthis paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention\nbudget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design\nprinciple for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as\ncompression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most\nrelevant to downstream tasks.

In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form.

However, the\nclassical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to\ninstability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or\ndata-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the\nso-called soft-constrained Schr\\\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the\nterminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation\nleads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.\n  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and\nprove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions\nconverge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on\nDoob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\\\"odinger\npotentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an\noptimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic\noptimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first\nquantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed\nlight on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,\nfine-tuning, and transfer learning."}

Using the generated postconditions as\nspecifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to\nsuggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to\nbe false alarms.\n  To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from\nnatural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the\nprocess, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate\ninformal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of\npostconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and\ncompare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative\npower of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of\nautomatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with\ndifferent LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation\nnl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at\ngenerating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the\ngenerated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from\ncorrect behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional\ncontracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions\nalone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally\nalign well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software\nverifiers to catch real-world bugs."}

In this work, we reveal\nthrough systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input\nperformance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between\nspeech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality\ngap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and\nspeech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech\nand text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction\n(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean\ndistance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly\ncorrelated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous\ntoken-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is\nobserved. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify\ntoken-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the\nmodality gap.

To evaluate our approach under these demanding\nconstraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state\nranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible\nones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that\nclosely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,\nour reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,\nobject-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on\nthat state alone.

We provide a\nrigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show\nthat its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase\nthat amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses\nconflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward\nzero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in\nwhich noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a\nsimilarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together\nwith clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where\nthe clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and\nmeta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we\npropose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates\nmean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable\nperformance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization.

Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM\nperformance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to\ntrivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is\na direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this\nquestion, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode\nstatement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily\nseparated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of\nlearned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that\nhave undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution\n(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving\nperturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more\nOOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge\nprobing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement\ntruthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to\nthose seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true\nand false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this\nability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These\nfindings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs\nmay learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only\nlimited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the\nutility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on\nimproving the robustness of learned knowledge representations."}

Instances in\nthe benchmark are triples $\\langle \\textit{old code}, \\textit{new code},\n\\textit{diff} \\rangle$ drawn from real commits in CommitPackFT, paired with\nautomatic metrics and a clear evaluation protocol. We use the benchmark to do a\nfocused empirical study of the unified diff format and run a cross-format\ncomparison of different diff representations. Our findings reveal that\ndifferent formats should be used depending on the use case and model size. For\nexample, representing diffs in search-replace format is good for larger models\nin the diff generation scenario, yet not suited well for diff analysis and\nsmaller models. The Diff-XYZ benchmark is a reusable foundation for assessing\nand improving diff handling in LLMs that can aid future development of diff\nformats and models editing code.

We argue that these two failure modes\nare unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective\ngeneration space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model\nconsiders for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with\nground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where\nmodels diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection\nmetrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity\nand uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,\nproviding interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.\nWe demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and\npredicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting\noverthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to\nexpand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs."}

Yet, their adoption in\npractice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world\ncode. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal\npostconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function\nnames, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as\nspecifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to\nsuggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to\nbe false alarms.\n  To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from\nnatural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the\nprocess, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate\ninformal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of\npostconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and\ncompare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative\npower of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of\nautomatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with\ndifferent LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation\nnl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at\ngenerating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the\ngenerated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from\ncorrect behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional\ncontracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions\nalone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally\nalign well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software\nverifiers to catch real-world bugs."}

Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription\nmechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each\nagricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of\nindividual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the\nmiddle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop\ncluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific\ncrop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model\nthat integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design\nenables both local specialization for individual crop types and global\ngeneralization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data\nprivacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models\nclosely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly\noutperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the\nadvantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,\nparticularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and\nprivacy-sensitive agricultural data."}

This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to\nassess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,\nRecombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)\ngenerates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue\nand continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined\nsequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and\nenables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we\nfind that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect\nenhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference\nwhen relevant cues (e.g., \"Hey, wait a minute\") are present. Although\ninstruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects\na hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics."}
