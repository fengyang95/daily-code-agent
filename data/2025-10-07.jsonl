While sound static analysis\ntools can detect all leaks, automatically repairing them remains challenging.\nPrior work took the output of a detection tool and attempted to repair only\nleaks from a hard-coded list of library resource types. That approach limits\nthe scope of repairable leaks: real-world code uses resource wrappers that\nstore a resource in a field and must themselves be closed. This paper makes\nfour key contributions to improve resource leak repair in the presence of\nwrappers. (1) It integrates inference of resource management specifications\ninto the repair pipeline, enabling extant fixing approaches to reason about\nwrappers. (2) It transforms programs into variants that are easier to analyze,\nmaking inference, detection, and fixing tools more effective; for instance, it\nmakes detection tools report problems closer to the root cause, often in a\nclient of a resource wrapper rather than within the wrapper class itself. (3) A\nnovel field containment analysis reasons about resource lifetimes, enabling\nrepair of more leaks involving resources stored in fields. (4) It introduces a\nnew repair pattern and more precise reasoning to better handle resources stored\nin non-final fields. Prior work fixed 41% of resource leak warnings in the NJR\nbenchmark suite; our implementation Arodnap fixes 68%."}

This mitigates noise in predicting 'absolute'\ncomprehensibility measurements, but is still useful for downstream\nsoftware-engineering tasks like assessing whether refactoring improves or\nhinders comprehensibility.\n  We conducted a study to assess and compare the effectiveness of absolute and\nrelative code comprehensibility prediction via machine learning.

However, as prompts grow\nmore complex, models often struggle to adhere to all instructions. This\ndifficulty is especially common when instructive prompts intertwine reasoning\ndirectives -- specifying what the model should solve -- with rigid formatting\nrequirements that dictate how the solution must be presented. The entanglement\ncreates competing goals for the model, suggesting that more explicit separation\nof these two aspects could lead to improved performance. To this front, we\nintroduce Deco-G, a decoding framework that explicitly decouples format\nadherence from task solving. Deco-G handles format compliance with a separate\ntractable probabilistic model (TPM), while prompts LLMs with only task\ninstructions. At each decoding step, Deco-G combines next token probabilities\nfrom the LLM with the TPM calculated format compliance likelihood to form the\noutput probability. To make this approach both practical and scalable for\nmodern instruction-tuned LLMs, we introduce three key innovations:\ninstruction-aware distillation, a flexible trie-building algorithm, and HMM\nstate pruning for computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nDeco-G across a wide range of tasks with diverse format requirements, including\nmathematical reasoning, LLM-as-a-judge, and event argument extraction.

Developers seeking clones are, of course,\ninterested in both types of clones. We confirm this claim through a literature\nreview, identifying three practical clone detection tasks in which the model's\ngoal is to detect clones of a functionality even if it was trained on clones of\ndifferent functionalities. In light of this finding, we re-evaluate six\nstate-of-the-art models, including both task-specific models and generative\nLLMs, on the task of detecting clones of unseen functionality. Our experiments\nreveal a drop in F1 of up to 48% (average 31%) for task-specific models.

This has led to on-the-fly syntax\nhighlighting, where visual annotations are generated just before content is\nserved, often at high request rates and under incomplete input conditions. To\nmeet these demands efficiently, state-of-the-art models use deep learning to\nlearn the behavior of brute-force syntax highlighting resolvers, tools that are\neasy to implement but too slow for production.

To\naddress these questions, this paper introduces the first theoretical framework\nfor analyzing the convergent optimal representations of MCL and the modality\nalignment when training is optimized. Specifically, we prove that without any\nconstraint or under the cone constraint, the modality gap converges to zero.\nUnder the subspace constraint (i.e., representations of two modalities fall\ninto two distinct hyperplanes due to dimension collapse), the modality gap\nconverges to the smallest angle between the two hyperplanes.

These candidates are generated by an LLM through the expansion of a\nset of seed prompts and are subsequently evaluated using an Upper Confidence\nBound (UCB) acquisition function in conjunction with the GP posterior. The\noptimization process iteratively refines the prompts based on a subset of the\ndata, aiming to improve classification accuracy while reducing the number of\nAPI calls by leveraging the prediction uncertainty of the LLM-based GP. The\nproposed BO-LLM algorithm is evaluated on two datasets, and its advantages are\ndiscussed in detail in this paper."}

Training a\ndiffusion model consists of learning how to denoise noisy samples at different\nnoise levels. When training diffusion models for point clouds such as molecules\nand proteins, there is often no canonical orientation that can be assigned. To\ncapture this symmetry, the true data samples are often augmented by\ntransforming them with random rotations sampled uniformly over $SO(3)$. Then,\nthe denoised predictions are often rotationally aligned via the Kabsch-Umeyama\nalgorithm to the ground truth samples before computing the loss.

To overcome this, we propose Decoupled Reward Policy\nOptimization (DRPO), a novel framework that decouples the length-based learning\nsignal of correct rollouts from incorrect ones.

While this insight naturally leads to penalty-based approaches,\nthey ignore crucial distinctions in how models distribute uncertainty, for\nexample between hedging toward incorrect answers versus hedging toward \"I don't\nknow\" responses. A novel evaluation metric, the Distributional Correctness\nScore (DCS), is introduced to solve this problem, i.e., of not considering a\nmodel's entire probability distribution over answer choices. DCS naturally\ndistinguishes between harmful overconfidence in wrong answers and uncertainty\nexpressed through abstention, providing scores in an interpretable default\nrange. Through theoretical analysis and illustrative examples, DCS is\ndemonstrated to offer a more nuanced and aligned evaluation paradigm that\nincentivises models to express genuine uncertainty rather than guessing.\nAdapting 12 existing evaluation benchmarks to DCS's variants and measuring\nperformance on six language models reveals that for half of the tested\nbenchmarks scores are negative across all tested models, indicating significant\ntendencies towards hallucination."}

This paper argues that such developments pose a\nfundamental challenge to the consistency of our mind-recognition practices.\nConsciousness attributions rely heavily, if not exclusively, on empirical\nevidence derived from behavior and interaction.

The loss function, dataset, and tuning of hyperparameters all\nplay an essential role in training a network, yet there is not much discussion\non the reliability or reproducibility of a training algorithm. With the rise in\npopularity of physics-informed loss functions, this raises the question of how\nreliable one's loss function is in conditioning a network to enforce a\nparticular boundary condition. Reporting the model variation is needed to\nassess a loss function's ability to consistently train a network to obey a\ngiven boundary condition, and provides a fairer comparison among different\nmethods. In this work, a Pix2Pix network predicting the stress fields of high\nelastic contrast composites is used as a case study. Several different loss\nfunctions enforcing stress equilibrium are implemented, with each displaying\ndifferent levels of variation in convergence, accuracy, and enforcing stress\nequilibrium across many training sessions. Suggested practices in reporting\nmodel variation are also shared."}

We attribute this\nphenomenon to the widespread use of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence regularizer, whose mode-seeking behavior keeps the policy trapped\ninside the base model's support region and hampers wider exploration. To\naddress this issue, we propose RAPO (Rewards-Aware Policy Optimization), an\nalgorithm to promote broader yet focused exploration.

Previously, we devised an \"enriched\" chart review protocol where a\n\"roadmap\" of auxiliary diagnoses (anchors) was used to recover missing values\nin EHR data (e.g., a diagnosis of impaired glycemic control might imply that a\nmissing hemoglobin A1c value would be considered unhealthy).

Now, we investigate the accuracy and scalability of\na roadmap-driven algorithm, based on ICD-10 codes (International Classification\nof Diseases, 10th revision), to mimic expert chart reviews and recover missing\nvalues. Materials and Methods: In addition to the clinicians' original roadmap\nfrom our previous work, we consider new versions that were iteratively refined\nusing large language models (LLM) in conjunction with clinical expertise to\nexpand the list of auxiliary diagnoses. Using chart reviews for 100 patients\nfrom the EHR at an extensive learning health system, we examine algorithm\nperformance with different roadmaps.

It shows that cross-entropy loss\ndecreases in a predictable power-law rate as the model size increases. However,\nrecent evidence indicates that this law breaks down at very large scales: the\nloss decreases more slowly than expected, which causes significant trouble for\ndeveloping large language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the root\ncause lies in the fact that cross-entropy itself does not truly scale; instead,\nonly one of its hidden components does. To investigate this, we introduce a\nnovel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy,\nSelf-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that\nthis decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization\nobjectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models\nspanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy\nfollows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely\ninvariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of\ncross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow\nlarger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at\nsmall scales but fails at very large ones. Our findings establish the\nerror-entropy scaling law as a more accurate description of model behavior.

To reconcile these\ncontradictory findings, we theoretically and empirically show that both\nperspectives are partially valid-each aligning with a separate phase in an\ninherent two-stage probability mass dynamic: (1) Exploitation stage: initially,\nthe model primarily samples explored high-reward and low-reward tokens, while\nrarely selecting the potentially optimal token. Positive advantage estimates\nincrease the probability of high-reward tokens and decrease those of low-reward\ntokens, yet the optimal token's probability remains largely unchanged during\nthis stage.

When a potentially optimal token-now receiving positive advantage\nestimates-is occasionally sampled, its probability increases, while those of\nthe originally high-reward tokens decrease. This dynamic suggests that\nover-exploitation during the exploitation stage may lead to capability boundary\nshrinkage, whereas prolonged training into the exploration stage can promote an\nexpansion of the reasoning capability boundary.

Among these techniques,\nWeight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) has been shown to improve both the\nlearning capacity and training stability of the vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) method by explicitly decomposing pre-trained weights into magnitude and\ndirectional components. In this work, we propose DoRAN, a new variant of DoRA\ndesigned to further stabilize training and boost the sample efficiency of DoRA.\nOur approach includes two key stages: (i) injecting noise into the denominator\nof DoRA's weight decomposition, which serves as an adaptive regularizer to\nmitigate instabilities; and (ii) replacing static low-rank matrices with\nauxiliary networks that generate them dynamically, enabling parameter coupling\nacross layers and yielding better sample efficiency in both theory and\npractice. Comprehensive experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that\nDoRAN consistently outperforms LoRA, DoRA, and other PEFT baselines.

We propose Curriculum Chaos Forecasting\n(CCF), a training paradigm that bridges this gap. CCF organizes training data\nbased on fundamental principles of dynamical systems theory, creating a\ncurriculum that progresses from simple, periodic behaviors to highly complex,\nchaotic dynamics. We quantify complexity using the largest Lyapunov exponent\nand attractor dimension, two well-established metrics of chaos. By first\ntraining a sequence model on predictable systems and gradually introducing more\nchaotic trajectories, CCF enables the model to build a robust and generalizable\nrepresentation of dynamical behaviors. We curate a library of over 50 synthetic\nODE/PDE systems to build this curriculum.

While useful in practice, what properties\nmake merging effective are poorly understood. This paper explores how the\noptimization process affects the loss landscape geometry and its impact on\nmerging success. We show that a single quantity -- the effective noise scale --\nunifies the impact of optimizer and data choices on model merging. Across\narchitectures and datasets, the effectiveness of merging success is a\nnon-monotonic function of effective noise, with a distinct optimum. Decomposing\nthis quantity, we find that larger learning rates, stronger weight decay,\nsmaller batch sizes, and data augmentation all independently modulate the\neffective noise scale, exhibiting the same qualitative trend. Unlike prior work\nthat connects optimizer noise to the flatness or generalization of individual\nminima, we show that it also affects the global loss landscape, predicting when\nindependently trained solutions can be merged. Our findings broaden the\nunderstanding of how optimization shapes the loss landscape geometry and its\ndownstream consequences for model merging, suggesting the possibility of\nfurther manipulating the training dynamics to improve merging effectiveness."}

To address these challenges, we propose a\nflow-matching refiner for the MCG task.

We also provide\nempirical results of the quantified uncertainty, showing that the uncertainty\nquantified by HybridFlow is calibrated and better aligns with model error than\nexisting methods for quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.\nHybridFlow addresses a key challenge in Bayesian deep learning, unifying\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainty modeling in a single robust framework."}

For novice programmers in\nparticular, these traces reflect the diverse reasoning processes they employ to\ncode, such as exploratory behavior to understand how a programming concept\nworks, re-strategizing in response to bugs, and personalizing stylistic\nchoices. In this work, we explore what can be learned from training language\nmodels on such reasoning traces: not just about code, but about coders, and\nparticularly students learning to program. We introduce a dataset of over 3.8\nmillion programming reasoning traces from users of Pencil Code, a free online\neducational platform used by students to learn simple programming concepts.\nCompared to models trained only on final programs or synthetically-generated\ntraces, we find that models trained on real traces are stronger at modeling\ndiverse student behavior. Through both behavioral and probing analyses, we also\nfind that many properties of code traces, such as goal backtracking or number\nof comments, can be predicted from learned representations of the students who\nwrite them. Building on this result, we show that we can help students recover\nfrom mistakes by steering code generation models to identify a sequence of\nedits that will results in more correct code while remaining close to the\noriginal student's style. Together, our results suggest that many properties of\ncode are properties of individual students and that training on edit traces can\nlead to models that are more steerable, more predictive of student behavior\nwhile programming, and better at generating programs in their final states.\nCode and data is available at https://github.com/meghabyte/pencilcode-public"}

Existing methods\nthat extend conformal prediction to sequential data rely on fitting a\nrelatively complex model to capture temporal dependencies.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Reservoir Conformal Prediction (ResCP), a novel\ntraining-free conformal prediction method for time series. Our approach\nleverages the efficiency and representation learning capabilities of reservoir\ncomputing to dynamically reweight conformity scores. In particular, we compute\nsimilarity scores among reservoir states and use them to adaptively reweight\nthe observed residuals at each step. With this approach, ResCP enables us to\naccount for local temporal dynamics when modeling the error distribution\nwithout compromising computational scalability. We prove that, under reasonable\nassumptions, ResCP achieves asymptotic conditional coverage, and we empirically\ndemonstrate its effectiveness across diverse forecasting tasks."}

Existing approaches build model families by training each\nsize independently, which is prohibitively expensive and provides only\ncoarse-grained size options. In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon that\nwe call boomerang distillation: starting from a large base model (the teacher),\none first distills down to a small student and then progressively reconstructs\nintermediate-sized models by re-incorporating blocks of teacher layers into the\nstudent without any additional training. This process produces zero-shot\ninterpolated models of many intermediate sizes whose performance scales\nsmoothly between the student and teacher, often matching or surpassing\npretrained or distilled models of the same size. We further analyze when this\ntype of interpolation succeeds, showing that alignment between teacher and\nstudent through pruning and distillation is essential. Boomerang distillation\nthus provides a simple and efficient way to generate fine-grained model\nfamilies, dramatically reducing training cost while enabling flexible\nadaptation across deployment environments.

In\nthis work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a\nnovel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify\npersistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning\napproach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs,\nand introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological\ndiscrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale\nsubgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that\nour loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific\nconditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in\ntackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs,\nbalancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious\ncorrelations.

Inspired by\ndictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight\nsharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection\nmatrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's\nparameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods\nrequiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in\nAttention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers\n- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix\natoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves\nbetter benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),\nlow-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at\ncomparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the\ndictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing\ncross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),\nMASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks\nwith 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning\nstrategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for\nparameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we\ninvestigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce\ntheir number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their\nperformance."}
