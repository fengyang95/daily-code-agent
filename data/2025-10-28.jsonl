To address\nthis gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of\nmulti-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level\nadaptive loss function.We begin by defining the \"Modality Gap\" as the\ndifference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and\nvisual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap\ndistribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian\nMixture Model (GMM).

In fact, a significant amount of\nSATD is also present in the test code, with many instances not fitting into\nexisting categories for the production code. This study aims to fill this gap\nand disclose the nature of SATD in the test code by examining its distribution\nand types. Moreover, the relation between its presence and test quality is also\nanalyzed. Our empirical study, involving 17,766 SATD comments (14,987 from\nproduction code, 2,779 from test code) collected from 50 repositories,\ndemonstrates that while SATD widely exists in test code, it is not directly\nassociated with test smells. Our study also presents comprehensive categories\nof SATD types in the test code, and machine learning models are developed to\nautomatically classify SATD comments based on their types for easier\nmanagement. Our results show that the CodeBERT-based model outperforms other\nmachine learning models in terms of recall and F1-score. However, the\nperformance varies on different types of SATD."}

These disparities are called token premiums. Having high\ntoken premiums leads to less throughput during training and increases costs at\ninference. In this paper, we show that even after controlling for dataset size,\nvocabulary size, and data content, monolingual tokenizers exhibit a wide range\nof token premiums across languages. To understand the cross-linguistic\ndifferences that cause these token premiums, we train a suite of approximately\n7,000 comparable monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages, manipulating\ntokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and dataset size. We measure token\npremiums and test for a relationship between factors such as data similarity\n(between tokenizer training and evaluation), vocabulary size, and\npre-tokenization. We also investigate the role of language-specific features\nsuch as writing system and word length. We find that similarity between\ntraining and test data does not impact token premiums, but vocabulary size and\npre-tokenization do. While simply increasing vocabulary size does not lead to\nreduced token premium effects, we can determine an ``optimal'' vocabulary size\nfor each language to achieve significantly reduced token premium effects. We\nalso train superword tokenizers which allow merges over whitespaces, and we\nfind that they both reduce token premium effects and improve compression\noverall.

We introduce\ncomputational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready\ncausal accounts.

Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent\nrandomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and\nrarely achieve consistently optimal results.

To understand the frequency and consequences\nof dependency pinning, we first define the concepts of stale and fresh pins,\nwhich are distinguished based on how outdated the dependency is relative to the\nrelease date of the project. We conduct an empirical study to show that over\n60% of consumers of popular Maven libraries contain stale pins to their\ndependencies, with some outdated versions over a year old.

PACR encodes\nthe inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the\nprobability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.\nWe provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive\nbias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically\nsound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches\nreward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple\nbenchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can\nmake RLVR training more effective and reliable."}

Diffusion modeling starts by defining a\nforward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data\ndistribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate\ndistributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise\nback into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three\ncomplementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational\nautoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The\nscore-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the\nevolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely\nregions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation\nas following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a\nlearned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a\ntime-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.\nSampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise\ninto data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph\ndiscusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,\nand diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between\narbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded\nunderstanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning\nknowledge."}

Defending against novel jailbreaks\nrepresents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed\nto make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant\nparadigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges\nand difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training\nmethods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper\nproposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,\ncentered on the Adversarial D\\'ej\\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not\nfundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from\nprevious attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32\nattack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract\nand compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with\nLLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen\nattacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,\nwith explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided\nby this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),\nwhich trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated\nattack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,\nincluding multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We\nalso demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data\nscale, is key to defending against novel attacks.\n\\textcolor{red}{\\textbf{Warning: This paper contains content that may be\nharmful or offensive in nature."}

Furthermore,\nits low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the\naccuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the\nnecessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from\n``post-hoc context cleaning\" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative\nreasoning\", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems\nfor real-time, resource-constrained deployments."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose\nGTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.\nGTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces\nfor different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in\nhyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel\nMamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent\nspace. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses\nspatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),\nenabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on\nthree real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation."}

To tackle the issues,\nthis paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction\n(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,\nadaptive, and effective.

The key challenge is to balance the potential\ntradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves\nforgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's\noriginal performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use\nmulti-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and\nutility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only\nguarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which\ncauses under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first\nmodel MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the\nunlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility\nloss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to\nunilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the\nadditional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an\nimplicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the\naforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,\nthereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU.

However, these models face a\nfundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the\ntokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,\nrisking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,\nintroducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally\nlimit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by\npositing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level\nstructured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby\nbypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through\na systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we\ntested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of\nboth. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and\nsubstantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion\nof the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades\nperformance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for\nmodels with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the\nprimary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to\ninterpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for\nreasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge.

To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel\nMulti-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical\ntime-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four\nspecialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys\ndataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and\nseries-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that\nembed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial\nautocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined\nwith raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment\nmodule to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM\nand projected for final forecasting.

The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the\nperformance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal\nstrategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass\nCIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and\nperforms as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight\nlearning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For\nexample, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve\n80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved\n75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to\ndynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample\nauxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and\ncan achieve strong results."}

To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,\na diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)\nno tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled\nexperiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal\nrelationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool\nhallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect\ntranscends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still\namplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,\nappearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is\nmerely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step\nthinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering\nand Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental\nreliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades\nutility.

We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding\n(DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms.\nFirst, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that\nestablishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different\nmodalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we\ndevelop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method,\nwhere a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide\ninformative cues for graph reconstruction.

Despite a recent study, which\nclaimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to\nensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as\na \\emph{perk} even \\emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a\nnovel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on\nmodel parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and\nnon-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power\nallocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which\nalso reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising\ntraining. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive\nnumerical results."}

Although the paradigm is effective for\npre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between\npre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts\npre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable\nprompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph\nprompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,\nthey often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In\nfact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations\nacross demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains\nbiases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we\npropose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness\nfor adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute\nbias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized\nattribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer,\nreducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message\nCalibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust\nthe message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of\nthe information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting\nmodules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct\nextensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to\nevaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed\nADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks."}
