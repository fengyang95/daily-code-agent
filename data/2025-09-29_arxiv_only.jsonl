While recent LLM-based and\nLLM-agent-based approaches improve accuracy, they struggle in large-scale\nrepositories due to concern mixing, where relevant logic is buried in large\nfunctions, and concern scattering, where related logic is dispersed across\nfiles.\n  To address these challenges, we propose RepoLens, a novel approach that\nabstracts and leverages conceptual knowledge from code repositories. RepoLens\ndecomposes fine-grained functionalities and recomposes them into high-level\nconcerns, semantically coherent clusters of functionalities that guide LLMs. It\noperates in two stages: an offline stage that extracts and enriches conceptual\nknowledge into a repository-wide knowledge base, and an online stage that\nretrieves issue-specific terms, clusters and ranks concerns by relevance, and\nintegrates them into localization workflows via minimally intrusive prompt\nenhancements. We evaluate RepoLens on SWE-Lancer-Loc, a benchmark of 216 tasks\nderived from SWE-Lancer. RepoLens consistently improves three state-of-the-art\ntools, namely AgentLess, OpenHands, and mini-SWE-agent, achieving average gains\nof over 22% in Hit@k and 46% in Recall@k for file- and function-level\nlocalization.

Agents are\ndesigned in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover\nhidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools\nmanagement, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale\nsetting, trajectories average \\textbf{200k+} tokens and \\textbf{400+} tool\ncalls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \\textbf{35k} tokens\nand involve more than \\textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive\nexperiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,\nwhereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap\nin agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in\nour task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth\nanalysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and\nattribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional\nfundamental capability gaps.\n\\href{https://github.com/StarDewXXX/UltraHorizon}{Our code will be available\nhere.}"}

To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by\ncaching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent\ntraining without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,\ninconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling\nsystem, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal\nfeasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level\nverifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,\nenabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply\naugmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically\nreplay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We\ndeploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct\ncomprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel\nenables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing\nfrontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks."}

In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden\nrepresentation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only\ndepends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their\nrepresentation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about\ntarget labels, thanks to weight decay.

We show that this is not an inherent failure but an\nartifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a\nsynthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear\nrelational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure\nsubstantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen\nreverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key\nrole in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this\nstructure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically\ndependent facts.

However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While\ngraph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,\nthey face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge\ngraphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted\ngraphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM\nextractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper\npresents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces\nMulti-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these\nlimitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of\na Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly\nincorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving\nSub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical\nlimitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static\ngraph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A\nmulti-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser\nagents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,\nanswer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and\nsubgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively\nbuild a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent\ndrawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise\nreasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning\nbenchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of\nMACER framework."}

Across seven public and one developed\nreasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or\nneutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal\ninference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining\n5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete\ninstructions."}

To address this, we\nintroduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that\nenables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference\nwithout incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training\nexperts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for\nhigh-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational\nbudgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings.\nOur results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective\nperformance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\\times$ the\ntraining-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher\nlevel."}

Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the\ndiscovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or\ninterpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that\nphysical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation\nprecision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC).

We\npropose a novel framework, named $\\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key\nstages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy\nlearning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature\nlearning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$\nacross layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden\nrepresentation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only\ndepends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their\nrepresentation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about\ntarget labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics\nfollows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local\nmaxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima\ninduced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they\nchange on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we\nprovably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on\nmissing features that need to be learned.

In particular, we\ntrained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material\nproperties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how\nincreasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and\ncompute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be\nmeasured with a power law relationship $L = \\alpha \\cdot N^{-\\beta}$, where\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We\nalso incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as\nthe amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is\nenabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other\nneural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected\nnetworks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained."}

In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression\nvia Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework\nthat replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse\nfactorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense\ndictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix.

Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of\ntransformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A\ncauses B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from\ntraining examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that\ntransformers are capable of learning connectivity on \"grid-like'' directed\ngraphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and\nconnectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that\nthe dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of\ntransformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional\ngrid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In\naddition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly\nbetter generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs.

We validate FRC on sentiment\nanalysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that\nit ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different\nmodel scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for\nmanaging subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and\nrobustness."}

Supervised classification models (SCMs),\nsuch as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to\ntheir inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while\nexcelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due\nto the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the\ndiversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most\napproaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability.\nTo address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for\nlegal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through\ntight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel\nTop-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM\nemploys syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions.

The\nresulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but\ncomputationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images\nand shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures\nor the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an\nalternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein\nspace and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$.

Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a\nsliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional\n$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d\nconstruction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields\nthe double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures.

While particle-based\nsimulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference\nremains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are\nirreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail\nto converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator\n(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a\nsingle graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate\ninverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse\nthe underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design\nbased on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling\nforward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and\nefficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three\ndissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS\nachieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the\nparameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than\noptimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed\nof strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates\niterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On\ngoal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex\ntarget shapes (e.g., characters \"L\" and \"N\") through vivid, physically\nconsistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible\nframework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid\nsystems."}

Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of\ntransformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A\ncauses B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt.

In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes.

Even as the foundational\nreasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a\nmodel's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often\nrevealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity\nbetween its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present\nA2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge\nthe gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this\nframework, an \"explorer\" model first generates potential solutions in parallel\nthrough repeated sampling. Subsequently,a \"synthesizer\" model integrates these\nreferences for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage\nprocess allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential\nmethods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a\nplug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's\ncapabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the\nQwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its\nself-consistency baseline.

RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes\nerrors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level\ncharacteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math\nreasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61\npoints in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently\noutperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts.

Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of\ntransformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A\ncauses B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from\ntraining examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that\ntransformers are capable of learning connectivity on \"grid-like'' directed\ngraphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and\nconnectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that\nthe dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of\ntransformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional\ngrid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In\naddition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly\nbetter generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs.
