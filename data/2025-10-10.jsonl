This paper introduces\nL2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using\nLLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team\nof collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to\nachieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep\nfusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to\ntranslate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state\nrepresentation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than\nmerely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative\nstrategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security\nobjectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly\npenalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our\napproach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a\nnovel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.\nResults demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,\ndeep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key\nmetrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by\nover 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it\ndemonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,\npresenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure."}

This\nrenders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational\nprocess. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and\nanalyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the\nfull DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings.

A\nsignificant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their\nreliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or\nsecurity concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time\nGraph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without\naccessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as\na generative graph restoration problem, \"restoring the target graph to its\npristine, source-domain-like state\". There are two key challenges: (1) We need\nto construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective\nencoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We\nneed to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic\nfeatures of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To\nensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores\nthe target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.\nSpecifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent\nfeatures and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration\nprocess. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete\ntokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to\ntransform a \"noisy\" target graph into a \"native\" one. To further improve\nrestoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by\nspecialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach across various datasets."}

We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram\nthat exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative\nmagnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width.

Intuitively speaking, the flatter the\nlandscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.\nUnfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the\ngeneralization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap\nbetween the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,\ni.e., \\textit{R\\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\\'enyi\nentropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss\nHessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \\textit{uniform}\n(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping\nthe sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the\n\\textit{R\\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of\nthe eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller\nthe (R\\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between\ngeneralization and (R\\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization\nbounds in terms of R\\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the\nreparametrization invariance property of R\\'enyi sharpness, as well as the\ntrick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.\nFurthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong\ncorrelation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\\'enyi\nsharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\\'enyi\nSharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\\'enyi Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware\nminimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our\nproposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\\%, compared against the\nclassical SAM method."}

To address this, the\nDivide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training\ndata into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.\nThis strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the\ninfluence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation\ntypically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like\ndata size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying\ngeneralization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce\nDynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that\nrefines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions\nof subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,\nconsidering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent\naggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets\nyielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively\ncombating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning\nmultiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves\ngeneralization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss\ncurves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of\nDUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization\nperformance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,\nestablishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating\noverfitting in modern deep learning.

To mitigate these failures, we\nleverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy\nthree lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt\nrephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining\nor parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models\ndemonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe\nprompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a\nreproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,\nhighlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments."}

The task attracted diverse\nparticipation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and\nlimitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions\nstrengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and\nfindings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies."}

In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a\nframework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts\n(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our\nmethod introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes\na variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient\nlearning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO\nprovides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via\nuniversal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy\nspecialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;\nand (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables\nuser-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base\narchitectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert\nmodels, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and\nspecialization.

To overcome this\nlimitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models\nto allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and\nrestore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models\n(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a\nunique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images\nacquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of\nx2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity\nand distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded\ninconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This\nraises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently\ntarget the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting\ninformation, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the\nspecific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by\ncomparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to\npreserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was\nevaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far\nbetter mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences\nin model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity\nin image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics."}
