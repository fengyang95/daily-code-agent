We\nsystematically evaluate embedding-based retrieval, prompt-based listwise\nranking, and hybrid approaches, revealing that method effectiveness depends\nheavily on domain-specific factors rather than inherent algorithmic\nsuperiority. Through empirical investigation on enterprise-derived benchmarks,\nwe find that embedding-based methods offer superior latency for large tool\nrepositories, while listwise ranking provides better disambiguation for\noverlapping functionalities, with hybrid approaches showing promise in specific\ncontexts.

Existing\nbenchmark-based evaluations primarily offer descriptive statistics of model\naccuracy over datasets, providing limited insight into the probabilistic\nbehavior of LLMs under real operational conditions. This paper introduces\nHIP-LLM, a Hierarchical Imprecise Probability framework for modeling and\ninferring LLM reliability. Building upon the foundations of software\nreliability engineering, HIP-LLM defines LLM reliability as the probability of\nfailure-free operation over a specified number of future tasks under a given\nOperational Profile (OP). HIP-LLM represents dependencies across (sub-)domains\nhierarchically, enabling multi-level inference from subdomain to system-level\nreliability. HIP-LLM embeds imprecise priors to capture epistemic uncertainty\nand incorporates OPs to reflect usage contexts. It derives posterior\nreliability envelopes that quantify uncertainty across priors and data.\nExperiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIP-LLM offers a\nmore accurate and standardized reliability characterization than existing\nbenchmark and state-of-the-art approaches.

This symmetry\nexplains why models trained on reversed text can achieve comparable performance\nto those trained on forward text, despite the inherently time-asymmetric nature\nof human language and reasoning. We argue that this invariance represents a\nlimitation of current pretraining objectives rather than a benign artifact. If\nnatural language encodes directional dependencies - phonological,\nmorphological, or causal - a symmetric objective may fail to capture them.

Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA,\nIA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model\nfamilies (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B).

The results show that adapter-based\napproaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least\ndisruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In\ncontrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce\nsafety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and\nincreased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:\nLLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest\nsafety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation\nlayer, displays the greatest variance.

To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose ToM, a novel Tree-oriented MapReduce framework\nfor long-context reasoning. ToM leverages the inherent hierarchical structure\nof long documents (e.g., main headings and subheadings) by constructing a\nDocTree through hierarchical semantic parsing and performing bottom-up\naggregation. Using a Tree MapReduce approach, ToM enables recursive reasoning:\nin the Map step, rationales are generated at child nodes; in the Reduce step,\nthese rationales are aggregated across sibling nodes to resolve conflicts or\nreach consensus at parent nodes. Experimental results on 70B+ LLMs show that\nToM significantly outperforms existing divide-and-conquer frameworks and\nretrieval-augmented generation methods, achieving better logical coherence and\nlong-context reasoning.

These limitations reveal the weakness of the\nprevailing \"one-model-fits-all\" paradigm, particularly in safety-critical urban\ncontexts where simpler physics-based models can occasionally outperform\nadvanced networks (Kalman, 1960). To bridge this gap, we propose a dynamic\nmulti-expert gating framework that adaptively selects the most reliable\ntrajectory predictor among a physics-informed LSTM, a Transformer, and a\nfine-tuned GameFormer on a per-sample basis.\n  Our method leverages internal model signals (meta-features) such as stability\nand uncertainty (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016), which we demonstrate to be\nsubstantially more informative than geometric scene descriptors. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first work to formulate trajectory expert selection\nas a pairwise-ranking problem over internal model signals (Burges et al.,\n2005), directly optimizing decision quality without requiring post-hoc\ncalibration.\n  Evaluated on the nuPlan-mini dataset (Caesar et al., 2021) with 1,287\nsamples, our LLM-enhanced tri-expert gate achieves a Final Displacement Error\n(FDE) of 2.567 m, representing a 9.5 percent reduction over GameFormer (2.835\nm), and realizes 57.8 percent of the oracle performance bound. In open-loop\nsimulations, after trajectory horizon alignment, the same configuration reduces\nFDE on left-turn scenarios by approximately 10 percent, demonstrating\nconsistent improvements across both offline validation and open-loop\nevaluation. These results indicate that adaptive hybrid systems enhance\ntrajectory reliability in safety-critical autonomous driving, providing a\npractical pathway beyond static single-model paradigms."}

This review examines this convergence across three\nprinciples: automaticity, in which responses emerge from associative rather\nthan deliberative processes; suppressed monitoring, leading to errors such as\nconfabulation in hypnosis and hallucination in LLMs; and heightened contextual\ndependency, where immediate cues (for example, the suggestion of a therapist or\nthe prompt of the user) override stable knowledge.\n  These mechanisms reveal an observer-relative meaning gap: both systems\nproduce coherent but ungrounded outputs that require an external interpreter to\nsupply meaning. Hypnosis and LLMs also exemplify functional agency - the\ncapacity for complex, goal-directed, context-sensitive behavior - without\nsubjective agency, the conscious awareness of intention and ownership that\ndefines human action. This distinction clarifies how purposive behavior can\nemerge without self-reflective consciousness, governed instead by structural\nand contextual dynamics.

While full fine-tuning is a powerful\nadaptation method, it is computationally expensive and can lead to a\ndegradation of general reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as catastrophic\nforgetting. A range of alternative techniques exists, each with its own\ntrade-offs. In-Context Learning (ICL) is fast but limited by context length,\nwhile Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) offer a middle ground by minimizing parameter changes.

Despite advancements in algorithm design, existing\napproaches suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient learning of\nnoise-contaminated unimodal data, leading to corrupted cross-modal\ninteractions, and inadequate fusion of multimodal representations, resulting in\ndiscarding discriminative unimodal information while retaining multimodal\nredundant information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nDouble Information Bottleneck (DIB) strategy to obtain a powerful, unified\ncompact multimodal representation. Implemented within the framework of low-rank\nRenyi's entropy functional, DIB offers enhanced robustness against diverse\nnoise sources and computational tractability for high-dimensional data, as\ncompared to the conventional Shannon entropy-based methods. The DIB comprises\ntwo key modules: 1) learning a sufficient and compressed representation of\nindividual unimodal data by maximizing the task-relevant information and\ndiscarding the superfluous information, and 2) ensuring the discriminative\nability of multimodal representation through a novel attention bottleneck\nfusion mechanism. Consequently, DIB yields a multimodal representation that\neffectively filters out noisy information from unimodal data while capturing\ninter-modal complementarity. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,\nCH-SIMS, and MVSA-Single validate the effectiveness of our method. The model\nachieves 47.4% accuracy under the Acc-7 metric on CMU-MOSI and 81.63% F1-score\non CH-SIMS, outperforming the second-best baseline by 1.19%.

To address these issues, we propose a novel framework\nfor generating distractors with controllable difficulty by leveraging both data\naugmentation and a multitask learning strategy. First, to create a\nhigh-quality, difficulty-annotated dataset, we introduce a two-way distractor\ngeneration process in order to produce diverse and plausible distractors. These\ncandidates are subsequently refined through filtering and then categorized by\ndifficulty using an ensemble QA system. Second, this newly created dataset is\nleveraged to train a difficulty-controllable generation model via multitask\nlearning. The framework includes carefully designed auxiliary tasks that\nenhance the model's semantic understanding of distractors and its ability to\nestimate their difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\ngenerates high-quality distractors across difficulty levels and substantially\noutperforms GPT-4o in aligning distractor difficulty with human perception."}

A Theoretical Perspective on Client-Side Optima", "comment": null, "summary": "Federated optimization is a constrained form of distributed optimization that\nenables training a global model without directly sharing client data. Although\nexisting algorithms can guarantee convergence in theory and often achieve\nstable training in practice, the reasons behind performance degradation under\ndata heterogeneity remain unclear. To address this gap, the main contribution\nof this paper is to provide a theoretical perspective that explains why such\ndegradation occurs. We introduce the assumption that heterogeneous client data\nlead to distinct local optima, and show that this assumption implies two key\nconsequences: 1) the distance among clients' local optima raises the lower\nbound of the global objective, making perfect fitting of all client data\nimpossible; and 2) in the final training stage, the global model oscillates\nwithin a region instead of converging to a single optimum, limiting its ability\nto fully fit the data.

This study introduces a novel\nsingle-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC,\ncircumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems\nthrough a centralized decision-making paradigm.

Reward design\nprioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue\nlength) to control actions.

In Germany, only 17.3% of hourly heavy rain\nevents between 2001 and 2018 were recorded by rain gauges, highlighting the\nlimitations of traditional monitoring systems. Radar data are another source\nthat effectively tracks ongoing precipitation; however, forecasting the\ndevelopment of heavy rain using radar alone remains challenging due to the\nbrief and unpredictable nature of such events. Our focus is on evaluating the\neffectiveness of fusing satellite and radar data for nowcasting. We develop a\nmultimodal nowcasting model that combines both radar and satellite imagery for\npredicting precipitation at lead times of 5, 15, and 30 minutes. We demonstrate\nthat this multimodal strategy significantly outperforms radar-only approaches.\nExperimental results show that integrating satellite data improves prediction\naccuracy, particularly for intense precipitation. The proposed model increases\nthe Critical Success Index for heavy rain by 4% and for violent rain by 3% at a\n5-minute lead time. Moreover, it maintains higher predictive skill at longer\nlead times, where radar-only performance declines. A qualitative analysis of\nthe severe flooding event in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany in\n2021 further illustrates the superior performance of the multimodal model.\nUnlike the radar-only model, which captures general precipitation patterns, the\nmultimodal model yields more detailed and accurate forecasts for regions\naffected by heavy rain.
