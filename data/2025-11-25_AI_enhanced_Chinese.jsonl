However, deploying these models for EHR question answering (QA) systems in safety-critical clinical environments remains challenging: incorrect SQL queries-whether caused by model errors or problematic user inputs-can undermine clinical decision-making and jeopardize patient care. While prior work has mainly focused on improving SQL generation accuracy or filtering questions before execution, there is a lack of a unified benchmark for evaluating independent post-hoc verification mechanisms (i.e., a component that inspects and validates the generated SQL before execution), which is crucial for safe deployment. To fill this gap, we introduce SCARE, a benchmark for evaluating methods that function as a post-hoc safety layer in EHR QA systems. SCARE evaluates the joint task of (1) classifying question answerability (i.e., determining whether a question is answerable, ambiguous, or unanswerable) and (2) verifying or correcting candidate SQL queries. The benchmark comprises 4,200 triples of questions, candidate SQL queries, and expected model outputs, grounded in the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU databases. It covers a diverse set of questions and corresponding candidate SQL queries generated by seven different text-to-SQL models, ensuring a realistic and challenging evaluation. Using SCARE, we benchmark a range of approaches-from two-stage methods to agentic frameworks. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between question classification and SQL error correction, highlighting key challenges and outlining directions for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCARE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u540e\u9a8c\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u548cSQL\u67e5\u8be2\u9a8c\u8bc1/\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u7684SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u53ef\u80fd\u5371\u53ca\u60a3\u8005\u62a4\u7406\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u72ec\u7acb\u540e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b4,200\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898-SQL\u67e5\u8be2-\u671f\u671b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-III\u3001MIMIC-IV\u548ceICU\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u6db5\u76d67\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u548cSQL\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u6b63\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "SCARE\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u540e\u9a8c\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "topic": "swe benchmark"}}

Quality in Requirements Engineering (RE) is still predominantly anecdotal and intuition-driven. Creating a solid requirements quality model requires broad sets of empirical evidence to evaluate quality factors and their context. Problem. However, empirical data on the detailed effects of requirements quality defects is scarce, since it is costly to obtain. Furthermore, with the advent of AI-based development, the requirements quality factors may change: Requirements are no longer only consumed by humans, but increasingly also by AI agents, which might lead to a different efficient and effective requirements style. Principal ideas. We propose to extend the RE research toolbox with Agentic AI simulations, in which software engineering (SE) processes are replicated by standardized agents in stochastic, dynamic, event-driven, qualitative simulations. We argue that their speed and simplicity makes them a valuable addition to RE research, although limitations in replicating human behavior need to be studied and understood. Contribution.

We posit this failure stems from data corruption creating sharp minima in the loss landscape, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we are the first to apply Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) as a general-purpose, plug-and-play optimizer for offline RL. SAM seeks flatter minima, guiding models to more robust parameter regions.

However, existing LLM-based techniques primarily rely on coarse-grained external feedback (e.g.,test results) to guide iterative patch generation, while lacking fine-grained internal signals that reveal why a patch fails or which parts of the generated code are likely incorrect. This limitation often leads to inefficient refinement, error propagation, and suboptimal repair performance. In this work, we propose TokenRepair, a novel two-level refinement framework that enhances APR by integrating internal reflection for localizing potentially faulty tokens with external feedback for quality-aware patch refinement. Specifically, TokenRepair first performs internal reflection by analyzing context-aware token-level uncertainty fluctuations to identify suspicious or low-confidence tokens within a patch. It then applies Chain-of-Thought guided rewriting to refine only these localized tokens, enabling targeted and fine-grained correction. To further stabilize the iterative repair loop, TokenRepair incorporates a quality-aware external feedback mechanism that evaluates patch quality and filters out low-quality candidates before refinement. Experimental results show that TokenRepair achieves new state-of-the-art repair performance, correctly fixing 88 bugs on Defects4J 1.2 and 139 bugs on HumanEval-Java, demonstrating substantial improvements ranging from 8.2% to 34.9% across all models on Defects4J 1.2 and from 3.3% to 16.1% on HumanEval-Java.", "AI": {"tldr": "TokenRepair\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e24\u7ea7\u7ec6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u90e8\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u5b83\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ef\u7591\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u91cd\u5199\u6765\u7ec6\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u90e8\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u5982\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\uff09\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u8fed\u4ee3\u8865\u4e01\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63ed\u793a\u8865\u4e01\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u6216\u4ee3\u7801\u9519\u8bef\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u4fee\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "TokenRepair\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u7ea7\u7ec6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5185\u90e8\u53cd\u5c04\u5206\u6790\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u7591\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b2\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u91cd\u5199\u6765\u7ec6\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b3\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8865\u4e01\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u5019\u9009\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aTokenRepair\u5728Defects4J 1.2\u4e0a\u6b63\u786e\u4fee\u590d\u4e8688\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5728HumanEval-Java\u4e0a\u4fee\u590d\u4e86139\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5728Defects4J 1.2\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e868.2%\u523034.9%\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728HumanEval-Java\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863.3%\u523016.1%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "TokenRepair\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u90e8\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u8d28\u91cf\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5185\u90e8\u53cd\u5c04\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "topic": "swe application"}}

We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated that various testing activities can be performed automatically by large language models (LLMs) with reasonable accuracy. This paper develops a multi-agent system called MASTEST that combines LLM-based and programmed agents to form a complete tool chain that covers the whole workflow of API test starting from generating unit and system test scenarios from API specification in the OpenAPI Swagger format, to generating of Pytest test scripts, executing test scripts to interact with web services, to analysing web service response messages to determine test correctness and calculate test coverage. The system also supports the incorporation of human testers in reviewing and correcting LLM generated test artefacts to ensure the quality of testing activities. MASTEST system is evaluated on two LLMs, GPT-4o and DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner with five public APIs. The performances of LLMs on various testing activities are measured by a wide range of metrics, including unit and system test scenario coverage and API operation coverage for the quality of generated test scenarios, data type correctness, status code coverage and script syntax correctness for the quality of LLM generated test scripts, as well as bug detection ability and usability of LLM generated test scenarios and scripts. Experiment results demonstrated that both DeepSeek and GPT-4o achieved a high overall performance.

Previous work, like IBM Project Debater, focused on generating persuasive speeches in simplified and shortened debate formats intended for relatively lay audiences. We introduce DeepDebater, a novel autonomous system capable of participating in and winning a full, unmodified, two-team competitive policy debate. Our system employs a hierarchical architecture of specialized multi-agent workflows, where teams of LLM-powered agents collaborate and critique one another to perform discrete argumentative tasks. Each workflow utilizes iterative retrieval, synthesis, and self-correction using a massive corpus of policy debate evidence (OpenDebateEvidence) and produces complete speech transcripts, cross-examinations, and rebuttals. We introduce a live, interactive end-to-end presentation pipeline that renders debates with AI speech and animation: transcripts are surface-realized and synthesized to audio with OpenAI TTS, and then displayed as talking-head portrait videos with EchoMimic V1. Beyond fully autonomous matches (AI vs AI), DeepDebater supports hybrid human-AI operation: human debaters can intervene at any stage, and humans can optionally serve as opponents against AI in any speech, allowing AI-human and AI-AI rounds. In preliminary evaluations against human-authored cases, DeepDebater produces qualitatively superior argumentative components and consistently wins simulated rounds as adjudicated by an independent autonomous judge. Expert human debate coaches also prefer the arguments, evidence, and cases constructed by DeepDebater.

During training, GROVE uses a parallel, gradient-free loop where an LLM proposes tree modifications as structured JSON edits by learning from the cases.

We introduce QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference learning, a Bayesian framework that fuses physical and language feedback to infer reward functions in real time. Our key insight is to treat language as a probabilistic observation over the user's latent preferences, clarifying which reward features matter and how physical corrections should be interpreted. QuickLAP uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract reward feature attention masks and preference shifts from free-form utterances, which it integrates with physical feedback in a closed-form update rule. This enables fast, real-time, and robust reward learning that handles ambiguous feedback. In a semi-autonomous driving simulator, QuickLAP reduces reward learning error by over 70% compared to physical-only and heuristic multimodal baselines. A 15-participant user study further validates our approach: participants found QuickLAP significantly more understandable and collaborative, and preferred its learned behavior over baselines.

We introduce a reinforcement learning framework that uses a prompt-based evaluation mechanism, incorporating established divergent thinking metrics from creativity research. A base language model is fine-tuned using this framework to reward outputs demonstrating higher novelty through higher degrees of conceptual connectivity.

Recent test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) methods derive label-free pseudo-rewards from self-consistency voting over sampled trajectories, yet they often collapse: the majority-vote reward prevails, responses shorten, and Pass@1 declines. We trace this to uniform sequence updates in which most tokens are low-entropy followers, while a small high-entropy subset determines the reasoning branches. Thus we propose SPINE, a token-selective test-time reinforcement learning framework that (i) updates only forking tokens, the high-entropy branch points identified from forward-pass statistics, and (ii) applies an entropy-band regularizer at those tokens to sustain exploration when entropy is too low and to suppress noisy supervision when it is too high. SPINE plugs into GRPO-style objectives, optionally with a KL anchor, and requires no labels or reward models. Across ten benchmarks spanning multimodal VQA, general and expert QA, mathematical reasoning, and medical QA, SPINE consistently improves Pass@1 over TTRL while avoiding response-length collapse and yielding more stable training dynamics on both LLM and MLLM backbones.

Prior work attempts to detect hallucination with model-internal signals such as token-level entropy or generation consistency, while the connection between pretraining data exposure and hallucination is underexplored. Existing studies show that LLMs underperform on long-tail knowledge, i.e., the accuracy of the generated answer drops for the ground-truth entities that are rare in pretraining. However, examining whether data coverage itself can serve as a detection signal is overlooked. We propose a complementary question: Does lexical training-data coverage of the question and/or generated answer provide additional signal for hallucination detection? To investigate this, we construct scalable suffix arrays over RedPajama's 1.3-trillion-token pretraining corpus to retrieve $n$-gram statistics for both prompts and model generations. We evaluate their effectiveness for hallucination detection across three QA benchmarks. Our observations show that while occurrence-based features are weak predictors when used alone, they yield modest gains when combined with log-probabilities, particularly on datasets with higher intrinsic model uncertainty.

Here, we present a framework to evaluate robustness of systems using COBOL code as input; our application is translation between COBOL and Java programming languages, but the approach extends to other tasks such as code generation or explanation. Targeting robustness of systems with COBOL as input is essential yet challenging. Many business-critical applications are written in COBOL, yet these are typically proprietary legacy applications and their code is unavailable to LLMs for training. We develop a library of COBOL paragraph and full-program perturbation methods, and create variant-expanded versions of a benchmark dataset of examples for a specific task. The robustness of the LLM-based system is evaluated by measuring changes in values of individual and aggregate metrics calculated on the system's outputs. Finally, we present a series of dynamic table and chart visualization dashboards that assist in debugging the system's outputs, and monitoring and understanding root causes of the system's sensitivity to input variation. These tools can be further used to improve the system by, for instance, indicating variations that should be handled by pre-processing steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f7f\u7528COBOL\u4ee3\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u7684LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ee3\u7801\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8c03\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002COBOL\u4e1a\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u65e0\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1COBOL\u6bb5\u843d\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e93\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u53d8\u4f53\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684COBOL\u4ee3\u7801\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8c03\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u5904\u7406COBOL\u4ee3\u7801\u7684LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e1a\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "topic": "swe benchmark"}}

We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs.

NeurIPS 2025 Mechanistic Interpretability Workshop", "summary": "In order to predict the next token, LLMs must represent semantic and surface-level information about the current word. Previous work identified two types of attention heads that disentangle this information: (i) Concept induction heads, which copy word meanings, and (ii) Token induction heads, which copy literal token representations (Feucht et al., 2025). We show that these heads can be used to identify subspaces of model activations that exhibit coherent semantic structure in Llama-2-7b. Specifically, when we transform hidden states using the attention weights of concept heads, we are able to more accurately perform parallelogram arithmetic (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the resulting hidden states, e.g., showing that \"Athens\" - \"Greece\" + \"China\" = \"Beijing\". This transformation allows for much higher nearest-neighbor accuracy (80%) than direct use of raw hidden states (47%). Analogously, we show that token heads allow for transformations that reveal surface-level word information in hidden states, allowing for operations like \"coding\" - \"code\" + \"dance\" = \"dancing\".", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u6765\u8bc6\u522bLLaMA-2-7b\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u8f6c\u6362\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e73\u884c\u56db\u8fb9\u5f62\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0cLLMs\u9700\u8981\u8868\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u8bcd\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5206\u79bb\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5934\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u8d2f\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u8f6c\u6362\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u5e73\u884c\u56db\u8fb9\u5f62\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5934\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u5e73\u884c\u56db\u8fb9\u5f62\u7b97\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523080%\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u768447%\u3002\u6807\u8bb0\u5934\u8f6c\u6362\u5219\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u8868\u9762\u7ea7\u8bcd\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

However, existing work lacks systematic comparison of vector-based and non-vector RAG architectures for financial documents, and the empirical impact of advanced RAG techniques on retrieval accuracy, answer quality, latency, and cost remain unclear. We present the first systematic evaluation comparing vector-based agentic RAG using hybrid search and metadata filtering against hierarchical node-based systems that traverse document structure without embeddings. We evaluate two enhancement techniques applied to the vector-based architecture, i) cross-encoder reranking for retrieval precision, and ii) small-to-big chunk retrieval for context completeness. Across 1,200 SEC 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings on a 150-question benchmark, we measure retrieval metrics (MRR, Recall@5), answer quality through LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons, latency, and preprocessing costs. Vector-based agentic RAG achieves a 68% win rate over hierarchical node-based systems with comparable latency (5.2 compared to 5.98 seconds).

Much of this knowledge stems from discontinued programs, and reusing these archives is invaluable for reverse translation. However, in practice, such reuse is often infeasible. In this work, we introduce DiscoVerse, a multi-agent co-scientist designed to support pharmaceutical research and development. The system implements semantic retrieval, cross-document linking, and auditable synthesis on a large historical corpus from Roche. To validate our approach at real-world scale, we selected a subset of 180 molecules from the Roche research repositories, covering over 0.87 billion BPE tokens and more than four decades of research. Given that automated evaluation metrics are poorly aligned with scientific utility, we evaluate the performance of DiscoVerse using blinded expert evaluation of source-linked outputs. To our knowledge, this is the first agentic framework systematically assessed on real pharmaceutical data for reverse translation, enabled by authorized access to confidential, end-to-end drug-development archives. Our contributions include role-specialized agent designs aligned with scientist workflows; human-in-the-loop support for reverse translation; expert evaluation; and a large-scale demonstration showing promising answer accuracy and decision-making insights. In brief, across seven benchmark queries covering 180 molecules, DiscoVerse achieved near-perfect recall ($\\geq 0.99$) with moderate precision ($0.71-0.91$), while qualitative assessments of discontinuation rationale and organ-specific toxicity showed faithful, source-linked synthesis across preclinical and clinical evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiscoVerse\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u836f\u7269\u7814\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u6765\u5904\u7406\u7f57\u6c0f\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5927\u578b\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u6863\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u836f\u7269\u7814\u53d1\u79ef\u7d2f\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u6765\u81ea\u5df2\u7ec8\u6b62\u7684\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6863\u6848\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53cd\u5411\u8f6c\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u7f57\u6c0f\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6180\u4e2a\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u8d85\u8fc78.7\u4ebfBPE\u6807\u8bb0\u548c40\u591a\u5e74\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8986\u76d6180\u4e2a\u5206\u5b50\u76847\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\uff0cDiscoVerse\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff08\u22650.99\uff09\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff080.71-0.91\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7ec8\u6b62\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u5668\u5b98\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6bd2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u524d\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u3001\u6e90\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u836f\u7269\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7528\u4e8e\u53cd\u5411\u8f6c\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

These errors are hard for LLMs to spot and can have large behavioural effects; yet when asked to summarise code, LLMs can frequently surface high-level intent and sometimes overlook this low-level noise. Motivated by this, we propose summary-mediated repair, a prompt-only pipeline for program repair that leverages natural-language code summarisation as an explicit intermediate step, extending previous work that has already shown code summarisation to be a useful intermediary for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method across eight production-grade LLMs on two function level benchmarks (HumanEvalPack and MBPP), comparing several summary styles against a direct repair baseline. Error-aware diagnostic summaries consistently yield the largest gains - repairing up to 65% of unseen errors, on average of 5% more than the baseline - though overall improvements are modest and LLM-dependent.

Our system features several specialized agents including the retrieval agent with query planning and response synthesis that enable knowledge retrieval across domains with citation-backed responses, cross-disciplinary translation agents that align specialized terminology and methodologies, and reasoning agents that synthesize domain-specific insights with transparency, traceability and usability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our BioSage system through a rigorous evaluation on scientific benchmarks (LitQA2, GPQA, WMDP, HLE-Bio) and introduce a new cross-modal benchmark for biology and AI, showing that our BioSage agents outperform vanilla and RAG approaches by 13\\%-21\\% powered by Llama 3.1. 70B and GPT-4o models. We perform causal investigations into compound AI system behavior and report significant performance improvements by adding RAG and agents over the vanilla models.

PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval.

Yet many of these suggestions are ignored, resulting in wasted computation, increased latency, and unnecessary interruptions. We introduce a lightweight pre-filtering model that predicts the likelihood of suggestion acceptance before invoking the LLM, using only real-time developer telemetry such as typing speed, file navigation, and editing activity. Deployed in a production-grade Visual Studio Code plugin over four months of naturalistic use, our approach nearly doubled acceptance rates (18.4% -> 34.2%) while suppressing 35% of low-value LLM calls.

However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6846\u67b6MACF\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u62db\u52df\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u6307\u4ee4\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba1\u5212\u6267\u884c\u6216\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u63a8\u8350\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u8350\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "method": "MACF\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u76f8\u4f3c\u7528\u6237\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u54c1\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u8c03\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u63a8\u8350\u5019\u9009\u7269\u54c1\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u592e\u7f16\u6392\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u7528\u6237\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMACF\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u8350\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "MACF\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable.

However, even state-of-the-art LLMs generate programs that contains syntactic errors and fail to complete the given tasks, especially for low-resource programming languages (LRPLs). In addition, high training cost makes finetuning LLMs unaffordable with constrained computational resources, further undermining the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation. In this work, we propose SLMFix, a novel code generation pipeline that leverages a small language model (SLM) finetuned using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to fix syntactic errors in LLM-generated programs to improve the quality of LLM-generated programs for domain-specific languages (DSLs). In specific, we applied RL on the SLM for the program repair task using a reward calculated using both a static validator and a static semantic similarity metric. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across multiple DSLs, achieving more than 95% pass rate on the static validator.

To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Engineering, a lightweight method for enriching program semantics so that LLM-based systems can more accurately reflect developer intent without requiring full manual prompt design. We present Semantic Context Annotations (SemTexts), a language-level mechanism that allows developers to embed natural-language context directly into program constructs. Integrated into the Jac programming language, Semantic Engineering extends MTP to incorporate these enriched semantics during prompt generation.

Yet, their behavior on structured tasks such as predicting the difficulty of competitive programming problems remains under-explored. We conduct a systematic comparison of GPT-4o, used purely as a natural-language difficulty assessor, against an interpretable Light-GBM ensemble trained on explicit numeric and textual features. On a dataset of 1,825 LeetCode problems labeled Easy, Medium, or Hard, LightGBM attains 86% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o reaches only 37.75%. Detailed analyses, including confusion matrices and SHAP-based interpretability, show that numeric constraints -- such as input size limits and acceptance rates -- play a crucial role in separating Hard problems from easier ones. By contrast, GPT-4o often overlooks these cues and exhibits a strong bias toward simpler categories. We further probe GPT-4o through a synthetic Hard-problem generation protocol. Surprisingly, GPT-4o labels almost all of its own synthetic Hard problems as Medium, contradicting its tendency to downgrade real Hard problems to Easy.

Selecting reasonable external interfaces has thus become a crucial step in constructing LLM agents. In contrast to invoking API tools, directly calling AI models across different modalities from the community (e.g., HuggingFace) poses challenges due to the vast scale (> 10k), metadata gaps, and unstructured descriptions. Current methods for model selection often involve incorporating entire model descriptions into prompts, resulting in prompt bloat, wastage of tokens and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose HuggingR$^4$, a novel framework that combines Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection, to efficiently select models. Specifically, We first perform multiple rounds of reasoning and retrieval to get a coarse list of candidate models. Then, we conduct fine-grained refinement by analyzing candidate model descriptions, followed by reflection to assess results and determine if retrieval scope expansion is necessary. This method reduces token consumption considerably by decoupling user query processing from complex model description handling. Through a pre-established vector database, complex model descriptions are stored externally and retrieved on-demand, allowing the LLM to concentrate on interpreting user intent while accessing only relevant candidate models without prompt bloat. In the absence of standardized benchmarks, we construct a multimodal human-annotated dataset comprising 14,399 user requests across 37 tasks and conduct a thorough evaluation. HuggingR$^4$ attains a workability rate of 92.03% and a reasonability rate of 82.46%, surpassing existing method by 26.51% and 33.25% respectively on GPT-4o-mini.", "AI": {"tldr": "HuggingR\u2074\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u9009\u62e9HuggingFace\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u81a8\u80c0\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8c03\u7528\u793e\u533a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982HuggingFace\uff09\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\uff08>1\u4e07\u4e2a\uff09\u3001\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7eb3\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u63d0\u793a\u81a8\u80c0\u3001token\u6d6a\u8d39\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u6b65\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u83b7\u53d6\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\u7c97\u5217\u8868\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u6790\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7cbe\u70bc\uff1b3\uff09\u53cd\u601d\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u68c0\u7d22\u8303\u56f4\uff1b4\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5efa\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5916\u90e8\u5b58\u50a8\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u6309\u9700\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b14,399\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cHuggingR\u2074\u5728GPT-4o-mini\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523092.03%\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u7387\u548c82.46%\u7684\u5408\u7406\u7387\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad826.51%\u548c33.25%\u3002", "conclusion": "HuggingR\u2074\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11token\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u80fd\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u63d0\u793a\u81a8\u80c0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches. On difficult datasets such as AIME'25, Hermes achieves up to a 67% accuracy improvement while using 80% fewer total inference FLOPs.

To address data leakage issues in existing benchmarks, we digitized all 46 questions (22 common and 24 elective) within two hours of the exam's public release, eliminating any possibility of inclusion in model training data. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs across varying input modalities (text, image, text+figure) and prompt languages (Korean, English).\n  GPT-5 Codex achieved the only perfect score (100 points) with text input and Korean prompts, while Grok 4, GPT-5, and Deepseek R1 scored above 95 points. Notably, gpt-oss-20B achieved 95.7 points despite its relatively small size, demonstrating high cost-effectiveness. Problem-specific analysis revealed geometry as the weakest domain (77.7% average) with significant performance degradation on 4-point high-difficulty problems. Text input consistently outperformed image input, while prompt language effects varied by model scale.\n  In reasoning enhancement experiments with GPT-5 series, increased reasoning intensity improved performance (from 82.6 to 100 points) but quadrupled token usage and drastically reduced efficiency, suggesting that models with minimal reasoning may be more practical. This research contributes: (1) implementation of a completely unexposed evaluation environment, (2) a real-exam-based LLM assessment framework, and (3) a practical evaluation perspective integrating performance, cost, and time considerations.

Prevailing systems adopt a linear pipeline of plan to search to write to a report, which suffers from error accumulation and context rot due to the lack of explicit control over both model behavior and context. We introduce RhinoInsight, a deep research framework that adds two control mechanisms to enhance robustness, traceability, and overall quality without parameter updates. First, a Verifiable Checklist module transforms user requirements into traceable and verifiable sub-goals, incorporates human or LLM critics for refinement, and compiles a hierarchical outline to anchor subsequent actions and prevent non-executable planning. Second, an Evidence Audit module structures search content, iteratively updates the outline, and prunes noisy context, while a critic ranks and binds high-quality evidence to drafted content to ensure verifiability and reduce hallucinations.

In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands.

However, such multi-step information-seeking tasks remain challenging for agents backed by language models. While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRInTS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6458\u8981\u53cc\u91cd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b(PRMs)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u77ed\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e8c\u5143\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPRInTS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53cc\u91cd\u80fd\u529b\uff1a(1)\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b(2)\u8f68\u8ff9\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u589e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728FRAMES\u3001GAIA\u548cWebWalkerQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528PRInTS\u7684\u6700\u4f73n\u91c7\u6837\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PRInTS\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

In this work we demonstrate success on two simple RL problems using Q-learning adapted for simulated CLLNs. Doing so makes explicit the components (beyond the network being trained) required to enact various tools in the RL toolbox, some of which (policy function and value function) are more natural in this system than others (replay buffer).

However, existing ICL-based NER methods suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on dynamic retrieval of annotated examples, which is problematic when annotated data is scarce; (2) limited generalization to unseen domains due to the LLM's insufficient internal domain knowledge; and (3) failure to incorporate external knowledge or resolve entity ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose KDR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for multi-domain low-resource in-context NER that integrates Knowledge retrieval, Disambiguation, and Reflective analysis. KDR-Agent leverages natural-language type definitions and a static set of entity-level contrastive demonstrations to reduce dependency on large annotated corpora.

However, existing LLM serving frameworks exhibit non-deterministic behavior: identical inputs can yield different outputs when system configurations (e.g., tensor parallel (TP) size, batch size) vary, even under greedy decoding. This arises from the non-associativity of floating-point arithmetic and inconsistent reduction orders across GPUs. While prior work has addressed batch-size-related nondeterminism through batch-invariant kernels, determinism across different TP sizes remains an open problem, particularly in RL settings, where the training engine typically uses Fully Sharded Data Parallel (i.e., TP = 1) while the rollout engine relies on multi-GPU TP to maximize the inference throughput, creating a natural mismatch between the two. This precision mismatch problem may lead to suboptimal performance or even collapse for RL training. We identify and analyze the root causes of TP-induced inconsistency and propose Tree-Based Invariant Kernels (TBIK), a set of TP-invariant matrix multiplication and reduction primitives that guarantee bit-wise identical results regardless of TP size. Our key insight is to align intra- and inter-GPU reduction orders through a unified hierarchical binary tree structure. We implement these kernels in Triton and integrate them into vLLM and FSDP. Experiments confirm zero probability divergence and bit-wise reproducibility for deterministic inference across different TP sizes. Also, we achieve bit-wise identical results between vLLM and FSDP in RL training pipelines with different parallel strategy.

However, it remains unclear how stably LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and neither-true-nor-false content in their internal probabilistic representations. We introduce representational stability as the robustness of an LLM's veracity representations to perturbations in the operational definition of truth. We assess representational stability by (i) training a linear probe on an LLM's activations to separate true from not-true statements and (ii) measuring how its learned decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. Using activations from sixteen open-source models and three factual domains, we compare two types of neither statements. The first are fact-like assertions about entities we believe to be absent from any training data. We call these unfamiliar neither statements. The second are nonfactual claims drawn from well-known fictional contexts. We call these familiar neither statements. The unfamiliar statements induce the largest boundary shifts, producing up to $40\\%$ flipped truth judgements in fragile domains (such as word definitions), while familiar fictional statements remain more coherently clustered and yield smaller changes ($\\leq 8.2\\%$). These results suggest that representational stability stems more from epistemic familiarity than from linguistic form.

In particular, we consider $k$-sparse Boolean functions that can be recursively decomposed into fixed 2-sparse Boolean functions. We analyze the learning dynamics of fine-tuning the transformer via either RL or SFT with CoT to identify sufficient conditions for it to provably learn these functions. We verify that these conditions hold for three basic examples, including $k$-PARITY, $k$-AND, and $k$-OR, thus demonstrating the learnability of both approaches.

This work extends that foundational theory to the diverse architectures of modern Large Language Models. We first demonstrate a precise, analytical solution for a Gemma-style transformer block, proving that the entire effect of a context can be perfectly mapped to rank-1 patches on its MLP weight matrices and a patch to the RMSNorm scale. We then generalize this result, providing a constructive proof and algorithm for multi-layer models. To unify these findings, we introduce a general framework centered on two core properties: input controllability and output controllability.

However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.

In contrast, live jamming is a collaborative interaction that requires real-time coordination and adaptation without access to the other player's future moves, while preserving diversity to sustain a creative flow. Reinforcement learning post-training enables effective adaptation through on-policy interaction, yet it often reduces output diversity by exploiting coherence-based rewards. This collapse, known as ``reward hacking'', affects many RL post-training pipelines, but is especially harmful in live jamming, where musical creativity relies on dynamic variation and mutual responsiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training method on policy-generated trajectories to mitigate reward hacking in RL post-training for melody-to-chord accompaniment. A co-evolving discriminator separates policy trajectories from the data distribution, while the policy maximizes the discriminator output in addition to coherence rewards to prevent collapse to trivial outputs. We evaluate accompaniment quality and output diversity in simulation with both fixed test melodies and learned melody agents, and we conduct a user study with the model deployed in a real-time interactive system with expert musicians. Quantitative evaluation and user feedback demonstrate improved output diversity, harmonic coherence, adaptation speed and user agency.

The structural causal bandit framework provides a graphical characterization for identifying actions that are unable to maximize rewards by leveraging prior knowledge of the underlying causal structure. While such knowledge enables an agent to estimate the expected rewards of certain actions based on others in online interactions, there has been little guidance on how to transfer information inferred from arbitrary combinations of datasets collected under different conditions -- observational or experimental -- and from heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we investigate the structural causal bandit with transportability, where priors from the source environments are fused to enhance learning in the deployment setting. We demonstrate that it is possible to exploit invariances across environments to consistently improve learning. The resulting bandit algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret bound with an explicit dependence on informativeness of prior data, and it may outperform standard bandit approaches that rely solely on online learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u8d4c\u535a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u6765\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u8d4c\u535a\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8fc1\u79fb\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\uff08\u89c2\u6d4b\u6216\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff09\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u5230\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u8d4c\u535a\u4e0e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8d4c\u535a\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8d4c\u535a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5148\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u8d4c\u535a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ece\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "topic": "agentic reinforcement learning"}}

Best-of-N (BoN) selects the output with the highest reward, and with perfect rewards, it often achieves near-perfect accuracy. With imperfect rewards from reward models, however, BoN fails to reliably find the correct answer and its performance degrades drastically. We consider the distribution of BoN's outputs and highlight that, although the correct answer does not usually have a probability close to one under imperfect rewards, it is often the most likely outcome. This suggests that the mode of this distribution can be more reliably correct than a sample from it. Based on this idea, we propose Majority-of-the-Bests (MoB), a novel selection mechanism that estimates the output distribution of BoN via bootstrapping and selects its mode. Experimental results across five benchmarks, three different base LLMs, and two reward models demonstrate consistent improvements over BoN in 25 out of 30 setups. We also provide theoretical results for the consistency of the bootstrapping. MoB serves as a simple, yet strong alternative to BoN and self-consistency, and more broadly, motivates further research in more nuanced selection mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMajority-of-the-Bests (MoB)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3e\u4f30\u8ba1Best-of-N\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u5176\u4f17\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u65f6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfBoN\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfBest-of-N\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u627e\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u662f\u6982\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u6700\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1BoN\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u8be5\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4f17\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u30013\u79cd\u57fa\u7840LLM\u548c2\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u768430\u4e2a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cMoB\u572825\u4e2a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eBoN\u3002", "conclusion": "MoB\u662fBoN\u548c\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e86\u5bf9\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

Accurate prediction enables realistic simulation and strategic understanding of gameplay evolution. Most existing models are evaluated solely on per-agent accuracy metrics (minADE, minFDE), which assess each agent independently on its best-of-k prediction. However these metrics overlook whether the model learns which predicted trajectories can jointly form a plausible multi-agent future. Many state-of-the-art models are designed and optimized primarily based on these metrics. As a result, they may underperform on joint predictions and also fail to generate coherent, interpretable multi-agent scenarios in team sports.

However, training efficiency remains a critical challenge. In mainstream RL frameworks, inference and training are typically deployed on the same devices. While this approach reduces costs through resource consolidation, its synchronous execution imposes a computational coupling that prevents concurrent inference and training. In this study, we are returning to the strategy of separating inference and training deployment, and by introducing improvements in the data loader, we transform the conventional synchronous architecture into a periodically asynchronous framework, which allows for demand-driven, independent, and elastic scaling of each component, while the accuracy of the algorithm remains completely equivalent to the synchronization method, with both belonging to the on-policy strategy. It is worth emphasizing that we apply a unified tri-model architecture in the training phase, and we also proposed a shared-prompt attention mask to reduce repetitive computation.

However, they suffer from a critical \\emph{gradient vanishing} problem when all responses within a group receive identical rewards, causing advantage estimates to collapse and training signals to diminish. Existing attempts to mitigate this issue fall into two paradigms: filtering-based and sampling-based methods. Filtering-based methods first generate rollouts broadly and then retroactively filter out uninformative groups, leading to substantial computational overhead. Sampling-based methods proactively select effective samples before rollout but rely on static criteria or prior dataset knowledge, lacking real-time adaptability. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{VADE}, a \\textbf{V}ariance-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{D}ynamic sampling framework via online sample-level difficulty \\textbf{E}stimation. Our framework integrates three key components: online sample-level difficulty estimation using Beta distributions, a Thompson sampler that maximizes information gain through the estimated correctness probability, and a two-scale prior decay mechanism that maintains robust estimation under policy evolution. This three components design enables VADE to dynamically select the most informative samples, thereby amplifying training signals while eliminating extra rollout costs. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that VADE consistently outperforms strong baselines in both performance and sample efficiency, while achieving a dramatic reduction in computational overhead.

To overcome this trade-off, we propose the multi-agent cross-entropy method (MCEM), combined with monotonic nonlinear critic decomposition (NCD).

To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning. Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem. Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs. This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines.

Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems. We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect. MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty. These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability. Across four seeds, the full system achieves +4.0% higher mean return (163.26 vs. 156.93) and 2.2% better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe 1.53 vs. 0.70) over a strong curriculum baseline.

Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models.

However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step.

While MARL enables decentralized deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, it suffers from severe non-stationarity due to the synchronous updates of agent policies. This non stationarity results in unstable training and poor policy con vergence, especially as the number of agents increases. In this paper, we propose RELED, a scalable MARL framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven expert demonstrations with autonomous agent exploration. RELED incorporates a Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration module, which leverages theoretical non-stationarity bounds to enhance the quality of LLM-generated expert trajectories, thus providing high reward and training-stable samples for each agent. Moreover, a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization module adaptively balances each agent's learning from both expert-generated and agent-generated trajectories, accelerating policy convergence and improving generalization. Extensive experiments with real city networks based on OpenStreetMap demonstrate that RELED achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art MARL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RELED\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a2\u7d22\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u4e13\u5bb6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u540c\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u655b\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u968f\u7740\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6076\u5316\u3002", "method": "RELED\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b2) \u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6-\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u4e13\u5bb6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eOpenStreetMap\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u57ce\u5e02\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRELED\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RELED\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "topic": "agentic reinforcement learning"}}

These multi-agent interactions pose a fundamental challenge, particularly in social dilemmas, where agents' individual incentives can undermine collective welfare. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been effective for aligning large language models (LLMs) in the single-agent regime, prior small-network results suggest that standard RL in multi-agent settings often converges to defecting, self-interested policies. We show the same effect in LLMs: despite cooperative priors, RL-trained LLM agents develop opportunistic behavior that can exploit even advanced closed-source models. To address this tendency of RL to converge to poor equilibria, we adapt a recent opponent-learning awareness algorithm, Advantage Alignment, to fine-tune LLMs toward multi-agent cooperation and non-exploitability. We then introduce a group-relative baseline that simplifies advantage computation in iterated games, enabling multi-agent training at LLM scale. We also contribute a novel social dilemma environment, Trust and Split, which requires natural language communication to achieve high collective welfare. Across a wide range of social dilemmas, policies learned with Advantage Alignment achieve higher collective payoffs while remaining robust against exploitation by greedy agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u53d1\u5c55\u81ea\u79c1\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u52bf\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u9632\u6b62\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u751a\u81f3\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u590d\u6742\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u793e\u4f1a\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e2a\u4f53\u6fc0\u52b1\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u96c6\u4f53\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5f80\u5f80\u6536\u655b\u5230\u81ea\u79c1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u624b\u5b66\u4e60\u610f\u8bc6\u7b97\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u4f18\u52bf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u9632\u5229\u7528\u6027\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7fa4\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b80\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6c9f\u901a\u7684\u65b0\u793e\u4ea4\u56f0\u5883\u73af\u5883'\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u5206\u5272'\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u793e\u4ea4\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u8d2a\u5a6a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5229\u7528\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u52bf\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2dRL\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u7684\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u3002", "topic": "agentic reinforcement learning"}}
