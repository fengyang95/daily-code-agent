We present Fortytwo, a\nnovel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed\npairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our\napproach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a\npeer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that\nsurfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom\nBradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference\nsubstantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond\nversus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of\n+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol\nincorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated\naccuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality\nor malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs\nproof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete\ncalibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making\nmulti-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.\nAcross six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and\nAIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to\nadversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation\nof only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while\nretaining practical deployability.

In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization\nstrategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.\nFirstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational\nconsumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define\nthem as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian\noptimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation\nwhile maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in\nvarious traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to\ndistinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust\ndecision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning\nand design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of\nperturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of\nour framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can\nreduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by\n3.9% to 8.5%"}

Despite its theoretical\nappeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of\nautonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal\noption termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that\nintegrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)\nmodule into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of\nstate trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred\nchange-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory\nsignals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain\nintra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce\nfunctional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over\nCPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the\nstandard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our\nframework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments\nare mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to\nautonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful\nskills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that\nCPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,\nand significantly improved option specialization.

This approach accelerates\nCoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.\nHowever, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)\nthey fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning\n(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,\nresulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on\nreducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the\nconsiderable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning\ntoken.

To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse\nreal-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona\n(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and\nNarrative Persona (role-based expression).

Our\ncomprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained\nformats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart\nin both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency.

Hughes"], "title": "Synthetic Data Reveals Generalization Gaps in Correlated Multiple Instance Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify\nhigh-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by\nprocessing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances\nseparately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby\npatches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a\nsynthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features\nis crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of\noff-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the\noptimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We\nempirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize\nas well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of\ninstances."}

Project page:\n  https://nkiyohara.github.io/nsf-neurips2025/", "summary": "Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy\nand irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine\nlearning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample\nbetween arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and\ntheir latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using\nconditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve\nproperties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling\nbetween arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at\nlarge time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world\ntracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy\ncomparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for\narbitrary time-point sampling."}
