To address this empirical\ngap, we present a large-scale study of AI agent-generated refactorings in\nreal-world open-source Java projects, analyzing 15,451 refactoring instances\nacross 12,256 pull requests and 14,988 commits derived from the AIDev dataset.\nOur empirical analysis shows that refactoring is a common and intentional\nactivity in this development paradigm, with agents explicitly targeting\nrefactoring in 26.1% of commits. Analysis of refactoring types reveals that\nagentic efforts are dominated by low-level, consistency-oriented edits, such as\nChange Variable Type (11.8%), Rename Parameter (10.4%), and Rename Variable\n(8.5%), reflecting a preference for localized improvements over the high-level\ndesign changes common in human refactoring.

To address these\nchallenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as\na method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a\nsmaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree\nto which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal\nrepresentations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current\naccuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality\nand often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity\nbetween the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically\nshow that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model,\nresulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks,\nwhich is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we\npropose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically\nevaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student\nmodels under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate\nMetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular\nlanguage models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation\ntechniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress\nidentifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring\nthe need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation\npipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing\ncompressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation."}

Our\nmain theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic\ncalibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a\nrecent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory\nrelies on a general definition of \"B-calibration,\" which is a notion of\ncalibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or\notherwise).

To address these issues, we propose two distinct and\ncomplementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging\nenvironment-specific information available during deployment.

Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large\nlanguage models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating\nthe tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring\npreservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the\nperformance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their\nlinguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a\nhuman benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral\n24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential\narchitectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a\ntempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a\nsuite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46),\nwhile preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also\nattains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a\ndisconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a\nstatistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a\ncomprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability,\ndiscourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for\nmechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five\nreadability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the\nevolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the\ninstruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics\nfor metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary\ndomain-adaptation issue for simplification."}

However, the\napplication of clustering is often heuristic, and the optimal methodology\nremains unclear. In this work, we establish connections between these\nunsupervised clustering methods and classical mixture models from statistics.\nThrough this framework, we demonstrate significant enhancements to these\nclustering methods, leading to the development of a novel model named SiamMM.\nOur method attains state-of-the-art performance across various self-supervised\nlearning benchmarks.

We present TUPANN (Transferable and Universal Physics-Aligned\nNowcasting Network), a satellite-only model trained on GOES-16 RRQPE. Unlike\nmost deep learning models for nowcasting, TUPANN decomposes the forecast into\nphysically meaningful components: a variational encoder-decoder infers motion\nand intensity fields from recent imagery under optical-flow supervision, a\nlead-time-conditioned MaxViT evolves the latent state, and a differentiable\nadvection operator reconstructs future frames. We evaluate TUPANN on both\nGOES-16 and IMERG data, in up to four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro,\nManaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times using the CSI and HSS metrics\nover 4-64 mm/h thresholds. Comparisons against optical-flow, deep learning and\nhybrid baselines show that TUPANN achieves the best or second-best skill in\nmost settings, with pronounced gains at higher thresholds. Training on multiple\ncities further improves performance, while cross-city experiments show modest\ndegradation and occasional gains for rare heavy-rain regimes. The model\nproduces smooth, interpretable motion fields aligned with numerical optical\nflow and runs in near real time due to the low latency of GOES-16. These\nresults indicate that physically aligned learning can provide nowcasts that are\nskillful, transferable and global."}

Wireless soil\nsensing has been explored to measure these four components; however, current\nsolutions require recalibration (i.e., retraining the data processing model) to\nhandle variations in soil texture, characterized by aluminosilicates (Al) and\norganic carbon (C), limiting their practicality. To address this, we introduce\nSoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that jointly measures six key\ncomponents: {M, N, P, K, C, Al}. By explicitly modeling C and Al, SoilX\neliminates texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. SoilX incorporates\nContrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL), with two customized terms: the\nOrthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to effectively disentangle\ncross-component interference. Additionally, we design a novel tetrahedral\nantenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism, which can robustly measure\nsoil dielectric permittivity independent of device placement. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that SoilX reduces estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5%\nover baselines and generalizes well to unseen fields."}
