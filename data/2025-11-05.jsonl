The versatile\nnature of LLMs makes them applicable to a wide range of such tasks. While the\nperformance of recent LLMs is generally outstanding, several studies have shown\nthat they can often produce incorrect results. Automatically identifying these\nfaulty behaviors is extremely useful for improving the effectiveness of LLMs.\nOne obstacle to this is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which\nnecessitates an oracle to determine the correctness of LLM behaviors.\nMetamorphic testing (MT) is a popular testing approach that alleviates this\noracle problem. At the core of MT are metamorphic relations (MRs), which define\nrelationships between the outputs of related inputs. MT can expose faulty\nbehaviors without the need for explicit oracles (e.g., labeled datasets). This\npaper presents the most comprehensive study of MT for LLMs to date. We\nconducted a literature review and collected 191 MRs for NLP tasks. We\nimplemented a representative subset (36 MRs) to conduct a series of experiments\nwith three popular LLMs, running approximately 560,000 metamorphic tests.

This distinction is critical for AI\nalignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human\nintentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in\npreference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the\ntraining phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately\ncorrelated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently\nprefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal\nlanguage) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,\npresenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,\ninformal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a\nmodel's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of\ngeneralizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.\nAcross 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize\ndeep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than\nsmaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three\nseparate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of\na core feature of alignment."}

Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse\ndataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in\nunimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes\nmodality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty\n(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent\nmodality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision.

Correlation analysis ($r \\approx 0.40\\text{--}0.65$) shows that the\nmodels often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make,\nhighlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike\nstandard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical\nprecision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance,\nphysics, health, and statistics."}
