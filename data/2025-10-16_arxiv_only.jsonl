Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often\ninduces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true\nobjectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves\nlearning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over\npairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and\ncorrect for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a\nnew preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a\ncumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based\nRL methods.

Static\nrepresentations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),\nare efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program\nwill behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic\nrepresentations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights\ninto performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks\ndue to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends\nthis trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program\nrepresentation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization\nsensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation\ngenerated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization\nsequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To\neffectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a\ncompositional learning approach.

Our key insight is that\ndomain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where\nlow-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and\nhigh-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we\npropose FracNet (\\underline{\\textbf{Fr}}equency \\underline{\\textbf{A}}ware\n\\underline{\\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \\underline{\\textbf{Net}}work) with two\nsynergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and\nlow-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption.

Experiments\nacross diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,\nnon-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.\nMoreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further\nenhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient\napproach to mechanistic activation steering."}

To mitigate this, recent methods\nemploy a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries,\nbased on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains\nconsistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely\nfocused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean\naggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work,\nwe argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean\naggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a\nsimple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time\napproach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases\nwith negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a\nnovel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV,\nwhich incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18\ndatasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x\nrespectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size.

Current studies often\noverlook the strategic use of information asymmetry in message design or rely\non strong assumptions regarding pre-commitment. In this work, we explore the\napplication of Bayesian Persuasion (BP) in natural language within single-turn\ndialogue settings, to enhance the strategic persuasion capabilities of LLMs.\nOur framework incorporates a commitment-communication mechanism, where the\npersuader explicitly outlines an information schema by narrating their\npotential types (e.g., honest or dishonest), thereby guiding the persuadee in\nperforming the intended Bayesian belief update. We evaluate two variants of our\napproach: Semi-Formal-Natural-Language (SFNL) BP and Fully-Natural-Language\n(FNL) BP, benchmarking them against both naive and strong non-BP (NBP)\nbaselines within a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework covers a\ndiverse set of persuadees -- including LLM instances with varying prompts and\nfine-tuning and human participants -- across tasks ranging from specially\ndesigned persuasion scenarios to general everyday situations.

However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial\nlimitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,\nwhich constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,\nespecially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that\ntrainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token\nselection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading\nwithout altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent\nlocality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer\nof selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall\ndecoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse\nattention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA\nintroduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into\nquery-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while\npreserving the same attention computation as used during training.

Temporal\nKnowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a\nstructured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However,\nexisting TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major\nchallenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving\nmulti-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal\noperators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency.\nTo address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal\nknowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured\ngrounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime\ndecomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time,\nenabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and\nco-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds.

Identifying\nDriver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,\nyet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by\ninconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an\ninnovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to\nautomatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the\nvalidity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of\ntwo-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on\ndetailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional\nmachine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a\nneural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,\nsurpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in\nscenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a\nprobabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original\ntest sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver\ndistraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one\ndriver substantially increased the likelihood of \"General Unsafe Driving\";\ndistraction for both drivers maximized the probability of \"Both Drivers Took\nHazardous Actions\"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the\nprobability of \"Speed and Stopping Violations.\" Our framework and analytical\nmethods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated\nDHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and\nintervention."}

Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often\ninduces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true\nobjectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves\nlearning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over\npairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and\ncorrect for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a\nnew preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a\ncumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based\nRL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR\nconsistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch\nfrom preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,\nrequiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies."}

We first distinguish attention heads\nbetween locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that\nlocally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating\nphrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad\ndownstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:\n1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward\nattention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which\nquantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives\nfrom subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring\npreplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range\ncontextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately\nfollowed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent\nreasoning.
