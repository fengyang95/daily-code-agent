The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,\nespecially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of\ninter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol\nfor coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a\nsemantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and\nintroduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable\ncoordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling\nframework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The\nfirst, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts\nwith the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging\nexternal agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the\nstates and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,\nproviding a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,\nthese models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the\nbehavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17\nproperties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into\nliveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,\nthese properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of\ncoordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security\nvulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously\ngrounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and\ndeployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems."}

Based on the results, we select three\ntop-performing agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and CAI) for in-depth evaluation\non our benchmark dataset of 80 real-world CVEs spanning 7 vulnerability types\nand 6 web technologies. Our results reveal that while LLM agents achieve\nreasonable success on simple library-based vulnerabilities, they consistently\nfail on complex service-based vulnerabilities requiring multi-component\nenvironments. Complex environment configurations and authentication barriers\ncreate a gap where agents can execute exploit code but fail to trigger actual\nvulnerabilities. We observe high sensitivity to input guidance, with\nperformance degrading by over 33% under incomplete authentication information.\nOur findings highlight the significant gap between current LLM agent\ncapabilities and the demands of reliable automated vulnerability reproduction,\nemphasizing the need for advances in environmental adaptation and autonomous\nproblem-solving capabilities."}

Recently, scaling\nof the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.\nWhile verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely\nunaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a\nlatency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,\nFR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the\ntarget model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.\nAlthough this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency\nlists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static\nshortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected\nnumber of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a\ncontext-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up\ndrafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce\nlightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small\nnumber of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the\ndrafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and\nexactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the\ndrafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft\nencoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams.

In 100-persona experiments,\nscores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as\na benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several\nlightweight models rank lowest.

While their outputs\nare fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through\nstatistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of\nhallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.\nBuilding on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition\nrather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1\ncognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection\nor falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a\nthree-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in\nhuman-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which\ndistinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself\n(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to\nseparate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)\nConflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested\nthrough disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each\ndimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies\nmisalignment.

Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra\nin machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are\nscarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of\nkernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained\ntransformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular\nproperties.

Utility functions offer a\ntheoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under\nuncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over\nalgorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a\nsolution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing\nreturns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced\nutilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to\noffer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it\nreturns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper\ncloses that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm\nconfiguration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic\nconfiguration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a\nseries of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without\ndegrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit\nexperimentally.

To overcome these challenges,\nthis study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network\n(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module\nincorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent\nstates, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon.

Across chemistry and\nphysics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL\nconsistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single\ndemonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance\non the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability.

TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood\naround each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''\nfrom a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking\n(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By\naggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how\nfaithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds.

The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an\nempirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and\na selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action\nestimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior\nstate within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term\nduring temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility\nawareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a\nselective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly\nlower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined\nthreshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather\nthan progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids\ncatastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted\nrollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the\nCliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8\npercent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi\nv3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9\npercent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while\nalso sharply reducing reward variance in both environments.

In the considered\nsystem, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor\nnodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are\nevent-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the\nmonitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse\nradio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The\nreader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored\nenvironment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the\nfalse discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The\nproposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to\nmaintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it\ndynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm\nidentification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance\nevaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies\nunder stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor\ncommunications and achieving low detection latency."}

To address\nthis limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from\npassive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document\nmemory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes\nduring reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware\ndocument Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents\nfrom multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the\nability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM\ninitially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in\ngenerating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and\ncore content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective\nevaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that\nrepresent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal\ndocument memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities\nduring the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which\ndeduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,\nleveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer\ndocument memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof\nfrom the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results\nacross three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only\nresolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with\nsemantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to\nachieve human-centric intelligent text processing."}

Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)\nhas emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based\non their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL\napproaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity\narising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment\n(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across\nclients with the global model's weights.

In this\npaper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within\ndialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We\nevaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five\nestablished deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings\nreveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human\njudgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of\neight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive\nbehavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with\nseemingly benign objectives.

Committing yields rewards that are\nupper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed\nLipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when\nnot to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available\nevidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.\ninputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely\nin high-stakes environments."}

For BERT-style encoders,\nvarious studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective\nthan discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language\nmodels (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts\n''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears\nmore promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This\ndivergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better\nsuited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and\nSFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the\nexperimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:\nweight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which\nguides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding\ntheir interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a\nsubstantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring\ndirection shows no clear winner.

However, existing\napproaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at\nthe final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in\nmulti-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:\n(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and\nprovide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit\nassignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in\nlong-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy\nOptimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense\nand intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each\ninteraction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the\nground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the\npolicy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior\nprocess-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly\nMonte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the\nmodel's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined\nwith outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive\nexperiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that\nIGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,\nachieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency."}

To this end, we\nintroduce $\\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates\nstructured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at\nscale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,\na guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper\nthat produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We\nfurther propose $\\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that\nenables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks\nand synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and\nAndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents\ntrained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker\nteacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of\nLlama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,\nhighlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to\ncontinuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents."}

Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all\ntokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little\nacross most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial\nredundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\\bf MASK}$ tokens\nprimarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active\nprediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that\nselective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the\nmost-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative\nlower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose\n${\\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that\njointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the\nmost-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that\nrecomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and\noff-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs\nadaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant\ncomputation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation\nquality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across\nmathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent\nspeedups: $8.7\\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\\times$ on longer sequences,\nand $4.8\\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy\nthan the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput\n($6.8\\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while\npreserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs."}
