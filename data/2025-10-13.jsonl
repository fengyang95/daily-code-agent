This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional,\nGUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction\nparadigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate\ntheir objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions\nacross multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However,\nextant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which\nintroduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For\nlanguage-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface\nparadigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative.\nThis limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of\nlocally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational\ncomponents for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine\nthe capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating\nuser intention resolution through machine assistance.

Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance\nsafety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we\nintroduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework\ndesigned to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time\nintervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to\nassign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low\nenergy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,\nEBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an \"energy landscape\". We use the\ngradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to\nlow energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in\nreal-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral\ncontrol from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with\nminimal computational overhead.

To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis\nfrom the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the\nfeatures of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.\nConcretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,\nexhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency\nbands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor\nsimilarity.

Second, they lack fine-grained semantic\nalignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets,\nresulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original\nsource. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured\nInstruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT\nconsists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the\nsyntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic\nsyntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality\nfine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation\nmodule aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and\ncontrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction\ntuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused\nby the introduction of syntactic information.

To that end\nwe propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a\nframework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,\nsupervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions\n(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only\ninteractions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales\nas first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more\nrobust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE\noutperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential\nrecommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE\nexhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and\ndemonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented\nquestion answering.

At batch\nsize 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800\ntokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to\nprior systems, dInfer delivers $10\\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while\nmaintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a\ncomparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which\nis highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers\n$2$-$3\\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at\nhttps://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer."}

Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss\nclosely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised\nContrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this\nloss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\\em Do CL and NSCL also remain\naligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their\nobjectives?}\n  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL\nmodels trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and\naugmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain\nsimilar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL\nstay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability\nguarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and\nrepresentational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment\nimproves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch\nsize. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently\nunstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with\ntraining time.\n  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL\nalignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more\nclosely than other supervised objectives.

Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,\nFinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic\nconsistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical\nconsistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.\nWe further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,\nclassification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive\nzero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models\nperform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical\ndimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over\nhierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic\nlimitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and\nestablish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,\nstructure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems.

Current context compression methods predominantly rely on\nautoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress\ncontextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to\nacquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a\nfundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge\nfrom actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial\nfor real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel\nmethod that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture\nthat is equipped with this compression capability \\textit{a priori}. Instead of\ntraining models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly\nselects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates\ncontextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving\nrepresentations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need\nfor autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly\nleveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor\nembeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)\nbidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture\ninformation from the entire context.

In this\npaper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task\ntraining is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.\nSpecifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with\nthe sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the\nold-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive\nbecause the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by\nchance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's\nlow-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the\ntwo directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.\nGradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of\nforgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward\npropagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We\npropose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves\naccuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods."}

Specifically, our framework introduces a novel\nExecution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided\nby a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge\nbase, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are\nimmediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their\ncorrectness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based\nCritic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our\nspecialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen\nseries models, validate the efficacy of our framework.

Given a private distribution $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to\ngenerate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in\n$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the\nfundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy\nguarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global\nminimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local\nperspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around\na fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on\nboth $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax\nrisk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class\n$\\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,\nwe (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP\nframework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler\nyields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.\nBuilding on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the\nlocally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of\n$f$-divergence.

About 10% of the global population\nis thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney\nfunction to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney\ndamage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are\ncrucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning\nmodels can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an\nenormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector\nnowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction\ncapability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive\ncomputer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is\nattained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing\nvalues; those are filled in using \"mean-mode\" and \"Random sampling method\"\nstrategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques\n(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision\nTree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance\nevaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the\ntechniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among\nthem, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%\naccuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and\nSVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%."}

However,existing physics-based and data-driven models\noften fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the\ninherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This\ngeneralization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples\navailable for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a\ngeo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water\ntemperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major\ninnovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which\nleverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and\npatterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware\nembedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design\nenables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by\ngeographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.\nWe evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which\nis a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37\nyears across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,\nGeo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both\nregions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results\nhighlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental\nmonitoring and decision-making."}

Under Review", "summary": "Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between\nlocally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that\nare rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing\nmodels typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time\nsteps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,\nand limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a\nlightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization\nthat adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into\ncompact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points\nacross multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence\ncriterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or\ngenerative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence\ncompression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a\nmodel-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised\ntime series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+\ndatasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30\narchives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,\ndemonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\\% of the full-model performance while\noffering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves\nrobustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming\nuniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position\nSTaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware\ntime series modeling."}

Cellular subpopulations may shift from\ncycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental\nfates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,\nposing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which\nassume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE\n(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural\ngating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable\ncomponents, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and\naccurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because\nagents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is\nespecially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our\nmethod on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.\nFirst, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task\nusing synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample\nsettings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks\nwhich simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we\ndeploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it\ncan not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also\npredict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding\nchallenge in computational biology."}

They\nwork under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to\npre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about\nhow to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the\nhardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base\ngenerative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward\noracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning\nchallenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose\nBaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the\nmodel using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward\nevaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of\nlearning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop\ngenerative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new\ndata resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from\nthem. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a\nsingle successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing\nnovelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,\nwhile using fewer reward evaluations."}
