However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by\ndefault, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the\nreal-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability\nwhen an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has\npassed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often\neither over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or\nunder-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge,\nwe introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across\n34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user\nquestion, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed\nsince the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue\nmessages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and\nevolving environments.

CUGA adopts a\nhierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond\nbenchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing\ntalent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,\nauditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce\nBPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary\nevaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while\nindicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution\nis twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at\nenterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this\ninitial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing\nresearch-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems."}

For example, at a pruning rate\nof $20\\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\\%$ on\nLLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\\%$-$30.52\\%$. Furthermore, CLP can\nbe seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with\nonly a slight performance loss."}

A general assumption of\ntraining the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that\nthe errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,\nthis assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by\nboth the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the\nperformance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current\nstudies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally\nAutocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed\nto systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic\nforecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a\nrandom Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a\nspatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic\ndependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error\ncorrelations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly\nformulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is\nintroduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned\ncoefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an\ninference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically\nrefine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time\nforecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on\ndifferent traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting\nmodels show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases."}

While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia\ndetection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in\nfeature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.\nTo address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional\nNeural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature\nextraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for\npneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a\nquanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2\nimage patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling\nlayers to generate non-classical feature representations. These\nquantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for\nclassification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves\na higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable\nclassical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and\nsample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,\nparticularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the\nfoundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical\ndiagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to\ntraditional approaches."}

To address these issues, we propose\nParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first\nstage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences\ninto functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and\nbranching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed\nReasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress\ninformation relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final\nanswer.

In this paper, we explore an extension to an\nestablished rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in\ncombination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows\nthe end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the\nprediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key\ncomponent with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant\nentities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a\ndata-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,\nwe investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved\nentities when performing category prediction."}

Previous research has\ndemonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden\ndimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to\nthe widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive\nlow-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed\nbottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply\nRoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of\nRoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a\nhigher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent\nspace, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on\nthese insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS\nprojects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and\nperforms sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this\nspace. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the\noverhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on\nvarious tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and\nadditionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct.

Causal discovery in time series is\nhindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal\nrelationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A\ncommon approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.\nTraditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of\nthe resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple\nvalid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We\npropose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based\ncausal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS\neffectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic\ngraph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We\nformalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the\nadditive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to\nenable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the\napproach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a\nscalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic\nbenchmarks ($d{=}\\!3-\\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\\!-\\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS\nimproves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the\nCausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\\!-\\!36$), while baselines remain the\nbest on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph\n$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These\nresults establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal\ndiscovery."}

Deep learning methods have\nrecently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving\npromising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their\nperformance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,\ninefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to\nexploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,\nwe introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation\nmodel for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges\nwith three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale\nsynthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an\nSO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational\nsymmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)\ncontrollable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system\nsupporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual\nunconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art\nperformance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating\naccurate (RMSD < 2 \\r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold\n3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters\nbenchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the\nnext best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers\n$3.6\\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug\ntargets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \\r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in\ntraining."}

In this work,\nwe propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable\neigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key\ndesiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability\nto modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,\nlow-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this\nframework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on\nsynthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the\nrecovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,\nenabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional\nrepresentations."}

That is\nsurprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control\napplications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,\nin this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous\ndriving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for\nlongitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort\nconstraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the\nlearning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more\neasily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and\nderive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning\ntechniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral\ncontrol, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the\nsame expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier\nto interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the\ninvestigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform\nthe best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies\nover actions."}

Despite its empirical\nsuccess, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning\nthe KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional\nchallenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the\nreward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs\nutilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general\npreference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and\nobtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over\nexisting ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that\ndirectly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to\nconstructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This\ninsight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy\nclass under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT\nmodel, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF."}
