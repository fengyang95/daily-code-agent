Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation.

This framework impacts philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to\nbe enacted and tested.

The main\ndistinctions between the two scenarios lie in the scope of defect prediction\nand the selected evaluation setups.

Peace integrates three key phases: dependency-aware\noptimizing function sequence construction, valid associated edits\nidentification, and efficiency optimization editing iteration. To rigorously\nevaluate the effectiveness of Peace, we construct PeacExec, the first benchmark\ncomprising 146 real-world optimization tasks from 47 high-impact GitHub Python\nprojects, along with highly qualified test cases and executable environments.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate Peace's superiority over the state-of-the-art\nbaselines, achieving a 69.2% correctness rate (pass@1), +46.9% opt rate, and\n0.840 speedup in execution efficiency. Notably, our Peace outperforms all\nbaselines by significant margins, particularly in complex optimization tasks\nwith multiple functions. Moreover, extensive experiments are also conducted to\nvalidate the contributions of each component in Peace, as well as the rationale\nand effectiveness of our hybrid framework design."}

Such interactions between users and an\nalgorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can\nguide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively\nengaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent\npreferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little\nlong-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.\nFocusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for\nsuch users to align the algorithm with their true interests?\n  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split\nbetween a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive\nsystem 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of\nalignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively\nsteer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are\nsufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are\ninstead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be\nlong, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal\n(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework\nexplains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven\nalgorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both\nthe challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment."}

Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval\napproaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and\ncomposition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete\ncapability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component\nselection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and\nreal-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured,\nautomated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the\nknapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically\nidentify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly\nconsidering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically\ntesting candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our\napproach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable\nreuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five\nbenchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer\nconsistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at\nsignificantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the\nsingle-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate\nimprovement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In\nmulti-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from\n37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents.

We investigate this question\nthrough entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along\nnumerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the\nNile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite\nhaving sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make\npredictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases\nthat strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order,\nand semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression\nusing only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the\nmodel's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override\nprincipled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters)\nselectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller\nmodels (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why\nlarger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more\naccurate knowledge.

In fact, each test\nenvironment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual\ntest emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test\nfocuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is\ndesirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only\none. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive\nPreference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences\nwith dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed\nto drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.\nEmploying a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased\nmodel, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected\nfeedback, leading to high performance in the factual test.

Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and\nproblem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution\npathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem\ndefinitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware\nloss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation\nand to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems.\nExperimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap\nand simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model\nin terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across\nthe MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks."}

Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large\nlanguage models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our\nresults indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling\ncrucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several\nbaseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning\nthrough prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on\nadditional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and\nCriminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these\nbaselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in\ntort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis\ntasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning\nchains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models."}

More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex\nrelationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while\nmaintaining physical consistency.

To that end, we show that for any $X\n\\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\\sqrt{\\log\nd}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\\Omega\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log(|X|)/\\log\nd}\\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of\ncombinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\\log d \\leq m \\leq \\sqrt{d}$--for\nwhich this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by\na factor of exactly $\\sqrt{\\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is\noptimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical\n$K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to\nestablish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path\nproblems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial\ndomains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD)\nalgorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is\niterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret\nguarantees for DAGs."}

We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model\nDeployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human\nengineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other\nknowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an\nunfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection\nof novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new\nclasses are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in\ntraditional OOD detection.

Four inversion approaches applied to\nthree test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data,\nespecially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the\ntraining data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it\nis entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not\nnecessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent\noverparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during\ntraining, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning\nthe GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to\nacceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this\napproach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which\ninfluences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can\nalready handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling\nworkflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best\nleverage them in support of geological interpretation."}

However, their zero-shot\nperformance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often\ncompromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical\ndownstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish\nbetween fine-grained classes such as \"fishing boat\" and \"yacht\" since their\nembeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user\ngoals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.\nTo address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad\ngeneralization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot\nclassifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate\nhigh-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high\nprecision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of\nuser-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery\nannotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning\nstrategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME\nidentifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision\nboundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample\ndiversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without\ncostly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then\na minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our\nmethod consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,\nestablishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting\nfoundation models to specific user needs."}

Despite the developments\nof accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely\nin simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real\nenvironments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current\nSim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies\nfor real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate\nwith the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and\nempirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this\nissue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world\nperformance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level\nRL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the\nsimulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world\nperformance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the\nmathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the\nSim2Real performance gap."}

This results in limited control over their operating points,\npreventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this\npaper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently\nimproving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically,\nwe first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs\nand show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative\nverbalized probabilities.

In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase\nwith thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML\nmodel trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the\ndynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we\ndevelop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical\nknowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical\nInformation-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics\nloss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV\nand SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the\ndaily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of\nsamples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and\nearly freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions."}
