This paper\nproposes a conjecture: the easier a representation is to parse, the better\nperformance the model achieves. We formalize this idea using grammar classes,\nwhere representations in simpler classes (e.g., LL(1)) are easier to parse.\nThrough a controlled experiment on a Python-based DSL, we show that parsing\ndifficulty strongly correlates with model performance. Motivated by this\nfinding, we present GramTrans, a general approach that automatically transforms\na context-free language into a representation within the LL(1) class.

In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does\nnot hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain\nhard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.\nInterestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different\nsubsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only\npart of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature\ndimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3\n(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME\n2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an\nadditional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS.

To\nbridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that\nsystematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target\nharmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse\nred-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to\neffectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel\nmultimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs\n(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming\nalgorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity\nand effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an\nepsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-\nand policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,\nexceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on\nClaude-4-Sonnet.

Drawing on recent work in\nphilosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the\nInter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to\naccurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using\nthe IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and\nbrain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject\nusing the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We\nidentify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network\nmodels, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We\nfind that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as\nthe non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC\nenables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high\nspecificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate\nresponse patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning\nsame-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a\nproof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural\nengineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal\nof identifying mechanistically accurate brain models.

The\ndataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types\n(likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity\npreceding it. This supports the development of agents that use\ncontext-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction\nbehaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data\nand evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous,\nethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an\nevaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for\nbuilding domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation\nand polarization."}

We introduce a\nunified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression\nto address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering\nprocedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter\nand activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our\nknowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic\nembedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's\narchitecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each\ncluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely\nlow-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per\ngroup while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage\nhierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to\nspecific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and\nthe volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision\nscheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled\nwith dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption\nto levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our\nframework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total\nparameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and\nlowering expert load variance by a factor of over three.

Paralinguistic features, such as age,\ngender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn\nconversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications\nfor fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we\nsystematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of\nmulti-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using\nGroup Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized\nstatistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like\nQwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o\nAudio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models\ngenerally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to\nage and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group\ndisparities.

While there are some theoretical and primary\nempirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped\ntransformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models\ntypically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue\nthat diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete\nspace.

We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens.

However, many deployments still rely on AR\ndrafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the\ndrafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that\nuses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts\nin a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR\nverifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,\nparallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally\nhighest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right\npath. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a\nspeed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two\npractical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this\nlattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and\n(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size\nbased on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length.

Experiments often discover a\ndiversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an\napproximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously\noverlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally\nnon-gradient \"curl\"-like components while still being able to effectively\noptimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with\ninhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,\nresulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any\nobjective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze\nfeedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher\nframework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons\nexhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of\nthe original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to\ngradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the\nsolution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of\nstability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In\nother cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to\ngradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by\ntemporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures\ncapable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an\nimportant counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in\nneural networks."}

However, existing self-reflection either performs\nrevisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training,\nboth fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose\nSelf-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time\nframework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token\ngeneration, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify\nhigh-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific\ncorrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a\nself-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By\nretrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more\ntrustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors\nat highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model\nreasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger\nself-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on\nPass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5.

Motivated by this, we\nstudy inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and\nprove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with\n$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting\nand BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),\nwith a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high\nfrequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards.

Previous methods typically address this by\nmaintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern\nmeaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that\nan unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and\ndestabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within\nRLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable\nlow-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning\nsparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are\nsystematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a\ndegeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability\nRegularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a\nheuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out\npresumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining\ncandidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of\n\\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft\nregularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL\ndivergence.
