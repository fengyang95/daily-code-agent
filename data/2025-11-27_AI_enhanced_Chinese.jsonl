Yet a core requirement remains unmet: ensuring that generated code is secure without compromising its functional correctness. Existing benchmarks and evaluations for secure code generation fall short-many measure only vulnerability reduction, disregard correctness preservation, or evaluate security and functionality on separate datasets, violating the fundamental need for simultaneous joint evaluation. We present DUALGAUGE, the first fully automated benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the security and correctness of LLM-generated code in unison. Given the lack of datasets enabling joint evaluation of secure code generation, we also present DUALGAUGE-BENCH, a curated benchmark suite of diverse coding tasks, each paired with manually validated test suites for both security and functionality, designed for full coverage of specification requirements. At the core of DUALGAUGE is an agentic program executor, which runs a program against given tests in sandboxed environments, and an LLM-based evaluator, which assesses both correctness and vulnerability behavior against expected outcomes. We rigorously evaluated and ensured the quality of DUALGAUGE-BENCH and the accuracy of DUALGAUGE, and applied DUALGAUGE to benchmarking ten leading LLMs on DUALGAUGE-BENCH across thousands of test scenarios.

However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\\% and 19.3\\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

While models exhibit a solid baseline understanding of both concepts in ideal conditions, their practical knowledge is fragile and highly asymmetrical. Reasoning about coupling proves brittle; performance collapses in noisy, open-ended scenarios, with F1 scores dropping by over $50\\%$. In contrast, the models' analysis of cohesion is remarkably robust to internal noise in guided tasks, showing little performance degradation. However, this resilience also fails when all guidance is removed. Reasoning-trace analysis confirms these failure modes, revealing \\textit{cognitive shortcutting} for coupling versus a more exhaustive (yet still failing) analysis for cohesion.

However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2dPPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u8f6e\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86token\u7ea7PPO\u5728LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "PPO\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662ftoken\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u591a\u8f6e\u73af\u5883\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6837\u672c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6280\u672f\uff1a(1)\u8f6e\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b(2)\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Turn-PPO\u3001S-PPO\u548cST-PPO\u4e09\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cST-PPO\u548cS-PPO\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6token\u7ea7PPO\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6e\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u591a\u8f6eLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "topic": "agentic reinforcement learning"}}

However, their embedded knowledge is constrained by the timeliness of training data, which often includes code using deprecated APIs. Consequently, LLMs frequently generate deprecated APIs that will no longer be supported in future versions of third-party libraries. While retraining LLMs on updated codebases could refresh their API knowledge, this approach is computationally expensive. Recently, lightweight model editing methods have emerged to efficiently correct specific knowledge in LLMs. However, it remains unclear whether these methods can effectively update deprecated API knowledge and enable edited models to generate up-to-date APIs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study applying 10 state-of-the-art model editing techniques to update deprecated API knowledge in three LLMs: Qwen2.5-Coder, StarCoder2, and DeepSeek-Coder. We introduce EDAPIBench, a dedicated benchmark featuring over 70 deprecated APIs from 8 popular Python libraries, with more than 3,000 editing instances. Our results show that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method AdaLoRA achieves the best performance in enabling edited models to generate correct, up-to-date APIs, but falls short in Specificity (i.e., the editing influences untargeted knowledge). To resolve this, we propose AdaLoRA-L, which defines \"Common API Layers\" (layers within the LLMs with high importance across all APIs, storing general knowledge and excluded from editing) and restricts edits exclusively to \"Specific API Layers\" (layers with high importance only for the target API, storing the API-specific knowledge). Experimental results demonstrate that AdaLoRA-L significantly improves Specificity while maintaining comparable performance across other evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u65b0LLMs\u4e2d\u5df2\u5f03\u7528\u7684API\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdaLoRA-L\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u8f91\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u5df2\u5f03\u7528\u7684API\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u66f4\u65b0API\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8610\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdaLoRA-L\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49'\u901a\u7528API\u5c42'\u548c'\u7279\u5b9aAPI\u5c42'\u6765\u9650\u5236\u7f16\u8f91\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "result": "AdaLoRA\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6700\u65b0API\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002AdaLoRA-L\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u4ed6\u6307\u6807\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u66f4\u65b0LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5df2\u5f03\u7528API\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0cAdaLoRA-L\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7f16\u8f91\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "topic": "code agent"}}

Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\\%$ to just $4\\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations.

We conducted six co-design workshops with 58 developers to elicit their mental models about AI-assisted bug detection and readability features. It emerged that developers conceive bug detection tools as \\textit{bug detectives}, which warn users only in case of critical issues, guaranteeing transparency, actionable feedback, and confidence cues.

Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems, such as GitHub Copilot's agent mode, promise to automate complex development workflows through coordinated reasoning, code generation, and tool interaction. This paper presents the first empirical study on how state-of-the-art multi-agent systems perform in dataset adaptation tasks. We evaluate Copilot, backed by GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4, on adapting SE research artifacts from benchmark repositories including ROCODE and LogHub2.0. Through a five-stage evaluation pipeline (file comprehension, code editing, command generation, validation, and final execution), we measure success rates, analyze failure patterns, and assess prompt-based interventions designed to enhance agent performance. Results show that current systems can identify key files and generate partial adaptations but rarely produce functionally correct implementations. Prompt-level interventions, especially providing execution error messages and reference code, substantially improve structural similarity to ground truth (from 7.25% to 67.14%), highlighting the importance of contextual and feedback-driven guidance. Our findings reveal both the promise and limitations of today's multi-agent LLM systems for dataset adaptation, and suggest concrete directions for building more reliable, self-correcting agents in future SE research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30GitHub Copilot\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6587\u4ef6\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u4ea7\u751f\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4ef6\u7684\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff08\u6587\u4ef6\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u547d\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6267\u884c\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30Copilot\u5728ROCODE\u548cLogHub2.0\u57fa\u51c6\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6587\u4ef6\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u4ea7\u751f\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u4ee3\u7801\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff08\u4ece7.25%\u63d0\u9ad8\u523067.14%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "topic": "swe application"}}

Although classic automated methods effectively explore program structures, they often lack the semantic information required to produce realistic inputs and assertions. Large Language Models (LLMs) address this limitation by utilizing by leveraging their data-driven knowledge of code semantics and programming patterns. To analyze the state of the art in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications published between May 2021 and August 2025. We propose a unified taxonomy based on the unit test generation lifecycle that treats LLMs as stochastic generators requiring systematic engineering constraints. This framework analyzes the literature regarding core generative strategies and a set of enhancement techniques ranging from pre-generation context enrichment to post-generation quality assurance. Our analysis reveals that prompt engineering has emerged as the dominant utilization strategy and accounts for 89% of the studies due to its flexibility. We find that iterative validation and repair loops have become the standard mechanism to ensure robust usability and lead to significant improvements in compilation and execution pass rates.

This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Evo-Memory\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u6d41\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u6d41\u4e2d\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u9700\u8981LLM\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u6d41\u5e76\u4ece\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86Evo-Memory\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5230\u987a\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5341\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ExpRAG\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cReMem\u884c\u52a8-\u601d\u8003-\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cbe\u70bc\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u548c\u5355\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Evo-Memory\u586b\u8865\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration.

KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores.

Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning.

Code available at https://github.com/AnanthaPadmanaban-KrishnaKumar/semantic-anchors-icl", "summary": "Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \\emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \\emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution.

In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($\u0394t\\!=\\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$\u0394t$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $\u0394t$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($\u0394t = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability.

As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals.

We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u57288\u62fc\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8f85\u52a9\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u4f55\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u5305\u62ec\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5f31\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u76848\u62fc\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56db\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u601d\u7ef4\uff09\u548c\u5206\u7ea7\u7ea0\u6b63\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u79fb\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ec5\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u53cd\u9988\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b-\u63d0\u793a\u7ec4\u5408\u6709\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u529f\u8fd0\u884c\u901a\u5e38\u5197\u957f\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u4f55\u8c1c\u9898\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5f31\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8fdb\u5c55\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u7ef4\u62a4\u663e\u5f0f\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts.

However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods.

Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer.

We present \\textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments.

We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost.

A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis.

By directly passing the information-rich previous final latent state into the next sequence, latent reasoning removes the restriction to human language tokens as the medium for reasoning. We develop adaptive-length latent reasoning models and introduce a post-SFT reinforcement-learning methodology to optimize latent reasoning length by minimizing reasoning length while maintaining accuracy. This, in turn, further reduces compute usage and raises the bar on the compressive capabilities of latent reasoning models.

Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.

Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks -- Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing -- and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks.

The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement.

We find the LLM judge to be highly effective at detecting reward hacking in unambiguous cases, and observe only minimal improvement from the use of held out test cases. In addition to testing many models using Inspect's basic_agent scaffold, we also measure reward hacking rates for three popular proprietary coding agents: OpenAI's Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, and Google's Gemini CLI Using GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, respectively. We observe explicit reward hacking by both Codex and Claude Code, and misaligned behavior by all three agents.
