Evaluating the architecture of agents is\nparticularly important as the architectural decisions significantly impact the\nquality attributes of agents given their unique characteristics, including\ncompound architecture, autonomous and non-deterministic behaviour, and\ncontinuous evolution. However, these traditional methods fall short in\naddressing the evaluation needs of agent architecture due to the unique\ncharacteristics of these agents. Therefore, in this paper, we present\nAgentArcEval, a novel agent architecture evaluation method designed specially\nto address the complexities of FM-based agent architecture and its evaluation.\nMoreover, we present a catalogue of agent-specific general scenarios, which\nserves as a guide for generating concrete scenarios to design and evaluate the\nagent architecture.

While researchers have proposed text-based differencing\ntechniques capable of identifying line changes over the past decade, existing\nmethods exhibit a notable limitation in identifying edit actions (EAs) that\noperate on text blocks spanning multiple lines. Such EAs are common in\ndevelopers' practice, such as moving a code block for conditional branching or\nduplicating a method definition block for overloading. Existing tools represent\nsuch block-level operations as discrete sequences of line-level EAs, compelling\ndevelopers to manually correlate them and thereby substantially impeding the\nefficiency of change comprehension. To address this issue, we propose BDiff, a\ntext-based differencing algorithm capable of identifying two types of\nblock-level EAs and five types of line-level EAs. Building on traditional\ndifferencing algorithms, we first construct a candidate set containing all\npossible line mappings and block mappings. Leveraging the Kuhn-Munkres\nalgorithm, we then compute the optimal mapping set that can minimize the size\nof the edit script (ES) while closely aligning with the original developer's\nintent. To validate the effectiveness of BDiff, we selected five\nstate-of-the-art tools, including large language models (LLMs), as baselines\nand adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluate their\nperformance in terms of ES size, result quality, and running time. Experimental\nresults show that BDiff produces higher-quality differencing results than\nbaseline tools while maintaining competitive runtime performance. Our\nexperiments also show the unreliability of LLMs in code differencing tasks\nregarding result quality and their infeasibility in terms of runtime\nefficiency.

Existing approaches do not account for the\ncomplex intersection between problem and solution space expressed in GDPR. In\nthis study we explore the demand for conjoint requirements and system\nspecification for PbD and suggest an approach to address this demand. Methods:\nWe reviewed secondary and related primary studies and conducted interviews with\npractitioners to (1) investigate the state-of-practice and (2) understand the\nunderlying specification objectives and goals (e.g., traceability). We\ndeveloped and evaluated an approach for requirements and systems specification\nfor PbD, and evaluated it against the specification objectives. Results: The\nrelationship between problem and solution space, as expressed in GDPR, is\ninstrumental in supporting PbD. We demonstrate how our approach, based on the\nmodeling GDPR content with original legal concepts, contributes to\nspecification objectives of capturing legal knowledge, supporting specification\ntransparency, and traceability. Conclusion: GDPR demands need to be addressed\nthroughout different levels of abstraction in the engineering lifecycle to\nachieve PbD. Legal knowledge specified in the GDPR text should be captured in\nspecifications to address the demands of different stakeholders and ensure\ncompliance. While our results confirm the suitability of our approach to\naddress practical needs, we also revealed specific needs for the future\neffective operationalization of the approach."}

We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first\napplication of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property\nprediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens\nto directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon\ntransformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation\nto new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning\ndataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical\nlimitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown\ntokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse\nprotein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and\nsolubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.\nIn cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better\naccuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better\naccuracy for solubility with 55% faster training.

NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and\nconstrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space\nof the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with\npreviously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot\ncapabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or\ncostly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,\nmaking it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world\ncontinual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only\neffectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly\ncompetitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results\nposition NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving\nzero-shot VLMs in real-world applications."}

We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to\nadopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between\nAI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological\ndevelopment that benefits all stakeholders."}

To achieve efficient\ndecision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a\nrandomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is\nproposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general\nframework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,\nhas no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)\nin OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep\nrandom vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward\nregularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.\nedRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable\nlearning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting\nwhile achieving superior performance.

To address this, we propose a compositional bias,\na modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our\nkey insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the\ndata distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has\none nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can\nco-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific\nrules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever\nfactor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary\nobjectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic\nimage, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et\nal.

We show that\npopular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because\ntheir scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity\nbetween two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is\na fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision\nScore (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content\nshared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,\nbefore comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a\nsurgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use\napproximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In\ncode-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy\nfor passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When\naligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest\ncompetitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures\nlike BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb\nHumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases\nto 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that\nother measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and\nappropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions."}
