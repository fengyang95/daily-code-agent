C51 is a popular DRL\nalgorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the\ndistribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update.

Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically\noperate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information\ndensity and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose\n\\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into\nstructured representations optimized for reasoning.

Pre-CR version", "summary": "Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a\ncornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient\ncare, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for\nadvancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their\nunstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts\nmake automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements\nin natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as\nequally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across\nclinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively\ngeneralize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present\nTACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to\naddress these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts\nduring training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL\ndynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual\nsamples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler\ncases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling\nmore complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including\nEnglish and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements\nacross diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission\nprediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the\nperformance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify\napproaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate,\nscalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions."}

Furthermore, we evaluate 15 popular readability\nmetrics across five English datasets, contrasting them with six more nuanced,\nmodel-based metrics. Our results show that four model-based metrics\nconsistently place among the top four in rank correlations with human\njudgments, while the best performing traditional metric achieves an average\nrank of 8.6.

In this paper,\nwe show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a\ncareful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of\nensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key\nfactors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models\nand consensus in their next-token probability distributions.

To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM.

In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions.

To support systematic study, we propose\nGuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented\nimages for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs\nand find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive\nsettings, indicating substantial room for improvement. Further analysis\nidentifies fine-grained perception and timely decision-making as key\nchallenges.

Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems\nfrom the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens\ndifficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of\nthe LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over\nvocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an\neigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,\nwe propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we\ndesign two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in\ngenerating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer\nconditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is\ndiscarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens\nautonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT\nsets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while\ncutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent\nmethods. On Math500 and AIME24, lexical probability-based latent reasoning also\nclearly surpasses hidden-state-based approaches. Our metrics of effective\ncompression rate and effective global parallelism further show that latent\nreasoning is both the compression of a single path and the superposition of\nmultiple paths."}

In this\npaper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific\nparadigm.

To this end, we\nintroduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free\nalgorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh\naugments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety\nby applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost\ncritic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.\nWe also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is\ndeterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the\nknowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight\nupper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic\naccuracy, that is always satisfied during training.

In this\nwork, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to\nguide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with\npreferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike\nconventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our\nmethod employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over\ntrajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for\nmanual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses\nthe learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic\napproach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy\nthrough iterative updates until convergence.\n  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that\nour approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with\ntemporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and\nautomaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our\nresults highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling\nnon-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent\nalternative to traditional reward modeling.

This paper presents a comprehensive\nevaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA\nof parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)\nframework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.\nCrucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on\ndata followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing\ntraining. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even\nthe worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error\nof 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism\ntrained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based\narchitectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph\nTransformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of\n3.5% and 2.6% respectively.
