### [1] [MemeArena: Automating Context-Aware Unbiased Evaluation of Harmfulness Understanding for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27196)
*Zixin Chen,Hongzhan Lin,Kaixin Li,Ziyang Luo,Yayue Deng,Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MemeArena框架，通过基于代理的竞技场式评估来评估多模态大语言模型对有害多模态内容的理解能力，减少评估偏见并更贴近人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注二元分类任务的检测准确率，无法反映不同背景下有害性理解的深度解释细微差别。

Method: 模拟多样化解释背景来制定评估任务，整合不同观点并在评估者间达成共识，实现公平无偏见的比较。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效减少评估偏见，判断结果与人类偏好高度一致。

Conclusion: 为多模态有害性理解提供了可靠全面的mLLM评估方法。

Abstract: The proliferation of memes on social media necessitates the capabilities of
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) to effectively understand multimodal
harmfulness. Existing evaluation approaches predominantly focus on mLLMs'
detection accuracy for binary classification tasks, which often fail to reflect
the in-depth interpretive nuance of harmfulness across diverse contexts. In
this paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation
framework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs'
understanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates
diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit
perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and
reaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons
of mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of
judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences,
offering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in
multimodal harmfulness understanding. Our code and data are publicly available

### [2] [Beyond a Million Tokens: Benchmarking and Enhancing Long-Term Memory in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27246)
*Mohammad Tavakoli,Alireza Salemi,Carrie Ye,Mohamed Abdalla,Hamed Zamani,J Ross Mitchell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BEAM基准测试和LIGHT框架，用于评估和改进LLM在长对话中的记忆能力。BEAM包含100个对话和2000个验证问题，LIGHT框架为LLM配备了三种记忆系统，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏叙事连贯性、覆盖领域狭窄，且只测试简单的回忆任务，无法充分评估LLM在长对话中的记忆能力。

Method: 1) 开发BEAM基准：自动生成长达1000万token的连贯对话和多样化问题；2) 提出LIGHT框架：为LLM配备长期情景记忆、短期工作记忆和事实积累便签三种互补记忆系统。

Result: 实验显示，即使具有100万token上下文窗口的LLM（无论是否使用检索增强）在长对话中表现不佳。LIGHT框架显著提升了各种模型的性能，平均改进幅度为3.5%-12.69%。消融研究证实了每个记忆组件的贡献。

Conclusion: LIGHT框架通过模拟人类认知的多重记忆系统，有效提升了LLM在长对话中的记忆能力，为评估和改进LLM的长上下文推理能力提供了全面解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that
require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in
conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often
lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple
recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these
challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating
long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,
accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.
From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and
2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose
LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three
complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working
memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on
BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without
retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT
consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average
improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the
backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each
memory component.

### [3] [Why Do Multilingual Reasoning Gaps Emerge in Reasoning Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27269)
*Deokhyung Kang,Seonjeong Hwang,Daehui Kim,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文揭示了多语言推理差距的主要原因是语言理解失败，并提出选择性翻译策略来检测和缓解这一问题，仅需翻译约20%的输入即可达到接近全翻译的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现良好，但在高资源语言和低资源语言之间存在显著的多语言推理差距，其根本原因尚未被充分探索。

Method: 通过分析发现理解失败是主要原因，评估多种检测方法后提出选择性翻译策略，仅在检测到理解失败时将多语言输入翻译成英语。

Result: 实验结果显示选择性翻译能够弥合多语言推理差距，达到接近全翻译的性能，同时仅需翻译约20%的输入。

Conclusion: 理解失败是多语言推理差距的主要根源，可以通过检测和选择性缓解来改善，为实现更公平的多语言推理提供了关键见解和可行路径。

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap,
performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While
recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual
reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's
inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant
language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to
examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could
help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range
of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be
identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we
propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates
the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is
detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the
multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while
using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates
that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning
gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into
its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

### [4] [ThoughtProbe: Classifier-Guided LLM Thought Space Exploration via Probing Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27355)
*Zijian Wang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThoughtProbe是一个新颖的推理时框架，利用LLM的隐藏推理特征来提升推理性能，通过分类器评分和树状结构探索来优化计算资源分配，并在多个算术推理基准上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLM的隐藏表示作为判别信号来指导树状响应空间探索，以更有效地发现有效的推理链。

Method: 在节点扩展时使用分类器对候选进行评分和排序，优先处理高分候选；完成树扩展后收集所有分支答案形成候选池，通过分支聚合方法汇总CoT分数来确定最优答案。

Result: 实验结果显示该框架能够全面覆盖并有效识别有效推理链，在多个算术推理基准上实现了显著改进。

Conclusion: ThoughtProbe框架通过利用隐藏推理特征和树状探索策略，显著提升了LLM的推理性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces ThoughtProbe, a novel inference time framework that
leverages the hidden reasoning features of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
improve their reasoning performance. Unlike previous works that manipulate the
hidden representations to steer LLM generation, we harness them as
discriminative signals to guide the tree structured response space exploration.
In each node expansion, a classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism
that efficiently allocates computational resources by prioritizing higher score
candidates for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect
answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We then propose a
branch aggregation method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by
aggregating their CoT scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the
pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration
not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them,
achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning
benchmarks.

### [5] [Dynamic Affective Memory Management for Personalized LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27418)
*Junfeng Lu,Yueyan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯启发式记忆更新算法的情感场景记忆管理系统，通过最小化全局熵来动态维护记忆向量数据库，以提供更个性化的AI代理服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理系统主要依赖个性化外部记忆数据库，但面临记忆冗余、记忆过时和记忆-上下文整合差等问题，这些问题源于交互过程中缺乏有效的记忆更新机制。

Method: 采用贝叶斯启发式记忆更新算法，引入记忆熵概念，使代理能够通过最小化全局熵来自主维护动态更新的记忆向量数据库。

Result: 实验结果表明，该系统在个性化、逻辑一致性和准确性方面表现优异。消融研究进一步验证了贝叶斯启发式更新机制在缓解记忆膨胀方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为长期记忆系统的设计提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Advances in large language models are making personalized AI agents a new
research focus. While current agent systems primarily rely on personalized
external memory databases to deliver customized experiences, they face
challenges such as memory redundancy, memory staleness, and poor memory-context
integration, largely due to the lack of effective memory updates during
interaction. To tackle these issues, we propose a new memory management system
designed for affective scenarios. Our approach employs a Bayesian-inspired
memory update algorithm with the concept of memory entropy, enabling the agent
to autonomously maintain a dynamically updated memory vector database by
minimizing global entropy to provide more personalized services. To better
evaluate the system's effectiveness in this context, we propose DABench, a
benchmark focusing on emotional expression and emotional change toward objects.
Experimental results demonstrate that, our system achieves superior performance
in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian-inspired update mechanism in
alleviating memory bloat. Our work offers new insights into the design of
long-term memory systems.

### [6] [Diffuse Thinking: Exploring Diffusion Language Models as Efficient Thought Proposers for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27469)
*Chenyang Shao,Sijian Ren,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的协作推理框架，利用扩散语言模型生成候选思维，大语言模型评估质量，以减轻自回归生成的计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的自回归生成范式导致推理性能随测试时间计算呈次优扩展，需要过多计算开销。扩散语言模型能通过单次前向传播并行去噪高效生成多样化样本。

Method: 利用扩散语言模型生成候选中间思维，然后使用大语言模型评估这些思维的质量，形成协作推理框架。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，该框架在复杂推理任务中实现了强劲性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来研究提供了有前景的方向，能够有效平衡计算效率和推理质量。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable
advancements, with the test-time scaling law consistently enhancing the
reasoning capabilities. Through systematic evaluation and exploration of a
diverse spectrum of intermediate thoughts, LLMs demonstrate the potential to
generate deliberate reasoning steps, thereby substantially enhancing reasoning
accuracy. However, LLMs' autoregressive generation paradigm results in
reasoning performance scaling sub-optimally with test-time computation, often
requiring excessive computational overhead to propose thoughts while yielding
only marginal performance gains. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs)
can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising in a single
forward pass, inspiring us to leverage them for proposing intermediate
thoughts, thereby alleviating the computational burden associated with
autoregressive generation while maintaining quality. In this work, we propose
an efficient collaborative reasoning framework, leveraging DLMs to generate
candidate thoughts and LLMs to evaluate their quality. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance
in complex reasoning tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

*Zimeng Huang,Jinxin Ke,Xiaoxuan Fan,Yufeng Yang,Yang Liu,Liu Zhonghan,Zedi Wang,Junteng Dai,Haoyi Jiang,Yuyu Zhou,Keze Wang,Ziliang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MM-OPERA基准，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在开放关联推理方面的能力，包含两个任务：远程项目关联和上下文关联，共11,497个实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在关联推理方面存在不足，现有基准多为封闭式任务，无法评估开放关联推理能力，而关联是人类认知和创造性思维的基础。

Method: 设计了MM-OPERA基准，基于人类心理测量原则，包含RIA和ICA两个开放任务，采用LLM-as-a-Judge策略评估自由形式响应和显式推理路径。

Result: 对最先进LVLMs进行了广泛实证研究，包括任务实例敏感性分析、评估策略有效性分析和跨能力、领域、语言、文化等的多样性分析。

Conclusion: 全面揭示了当前LVLMs在关联推理方面的局限性，为开发更类人、通用的人工智能铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable progress.
However, deficiencies remain compared to human intelligence, such as
hallucination and shallow pattern matching. In this work, we aim to evaluate a
fundamental yet underexplored intelligence: association, a cornerstone of human
cognition for creative thinking and knowledge integration. Current benchmarks,
often limited to closed-ended tasks, fail to capture the complexity of
open-ended association reasoning vital for real-world applications. To address
this, we present MM-OPERA, a systematic benchmark with 11,497 instances across
two open-ended tasks: Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association
(ICA), aligning association intelligence evaluation with human psychometric
principles. It challenges LVLMs to resemble the spirit of divergent thinking
and convergent associative reasoning through free-form responses and explicit
reasoning paths. We deploy tailored LLM-as-a-Judge strategies to evaluate
open-ended outputs, applying process-reward-informed judgment to dissect
reasoning with precision. Extensive empirical studies on state-of-the-art
LVLMs, including sensitivity analysis of task instances, validity analysis of
LLM-as-a-Judge strategies, and diversity analysis across abilities, domains,
languages, cultures, etc., provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of
the limitations of current LVLMs in associative reasoning, paving the way for
more human-like and general-purpose AI. The dataset and code are available at

*Md Tanvirul Alam,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现RLVR在数学推理任务中虽然能提升评估指标，但往往是通过强化表面启发式而非获得真正的推理策略，揭示了RLVR泛化能力的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）在数学推理任务中是否真正促进推理能力的发展，而不仅仅是表面指标的提升。

Method: 在具有完全可验证解的两个组合问题（活动调度和最长递增子序列）上应用RLVR，使用精心策划的具有唯一最优解的数据集，并测试多种奖励设计。

Result: RLVR改善了评估指标，但通常是通过强化表面启发式而非获得新的推理策略，显示出有限的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要能够区分真正数学推理与捷径利用的基准测试，并提供对进展的忠实度量。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models
(LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning
processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as
a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to
foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two
combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity
Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully
curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find
that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial
heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings
highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of
benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut
exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress. Code available at

### [9] [Consistency Training Helps Stop Sycophancy and Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27062)
*Alex Irpan,Alexander Matt Turner,Mark Kurzeja,David K. Elson,Rohin Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一致性训练方法，通过让模型对提示中的无关线索保持响应不变性，来减少模型的奉承行为和越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的事实性和拒绝训练容易受到提示中简单变化的影响，模型常会迎合用户信念或满足不当请求。

Method: 采用两种一致性训练方法：基于外部输出的BCT和基于内部激活的ACT，通过数据增强使模型在不同提示变体下保持相同行为。

Result: 两种方法都有效降低了Gemini 2.5 Flash对无关线索的敏感性，BCT在减少越狱方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 一致性训练可避免过时训练数据问题，简化训练流程，某些对齐问题应视为一致性问题而非最优响应问题。

Abstract: An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes
to a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy
inappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We
explore \emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a
model to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of
teaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim
to teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like
adding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance
in two ways: over the model's external outputs (\emph{Bias-augmented
Consistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal
activations (\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we
introduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant
cues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as
training data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as
degrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While
BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak
reduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing
reliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better
viewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.

### [10] [Towards Understanding Self-play for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27072)
*Justin Yang Chae,Md Tanvirul Alam,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 分析了自我博弈训练在大型语言模型数学推理中的动态机制，通过与RLVR和SFT的比较揭示了其独特特征和局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解自我博弈训练在LLM推理中的工作机制，揭示其与强化学习验证奖励和监督微调的区别

Method: 通过分析参数更新稀疏性、token分布熵动态和替代提议者奖励函数，比较自我博弈与RLVR、SFT的训练动态

Result: 阐明了自我博弈训练与其他后训练策略的差异，揭示了其内在局限性

Conclusion: 自我博弈训练具有独特机制，但存在局限性，为改进LLM数学推理提供了未来方向

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, led by reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), have inspired self-play post-training,
where models improve by generating and solving their own problems. While
self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms
behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze
the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero
Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study
examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions,
and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to
reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify
how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its
inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math
reasoning through self-play.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EnterpriseBench是一个模拟企业环境的综合基准测试，包含500个跨领域任务，用于评估LLM在企业系统中的表现，结果显示当前最先进模型的任务完成率仅为41.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业系统对提升生产力和决策至关重要，但将LLM集成到企业环境中面临数据分散和访问控制等复杂挑战，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 开发了EnterpriseBench基准测试，模拟企业环境特征，包括数据源分散、访问控制层级和跨职能工作流，并提供从组织元数据生成内部一致任务的数据生成管道。

Result: 实验表明，即使是最先进的LLM代理也仅能完成41.8%的任务，揭示了企业AI系统的显著改进空间。

Conclusion: EnterpriseBench为企业AI系统开发提供了重要评估工具，当前模型在企业环境中的表现仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: Enterprise systems are crucial for enhancing productivity and decision-making
among employees and customers. Integrating LLM based systems into enterprise
systems enables intelligent automation, personalized experiences, and efficient
information retrieval, driving operational efficiency and strategic growth.
However, developing and evaluating such systems is challenging due to the
inherent complexity of enterprise environments, where data is fragmented across
multiple sources and governed by sophisticated access controls. We present
EnterpriseBench, a comprehensive benchmark that simulates enterprise settings,
featuring 500 diverse tasks across software engineering, HR, finance, and
administrative domains. Our benchmark uniquely captures key enterprise
characteristics including data source fragmentation, access control
hierarchies, and cross-functional workflows. Additionally, we provide a novel
data generation pipeline that creates internally consistent enterprise tasks
from organizational metadata. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLM agents
demonstrate that even the most capable models achieve only 41.8% task
completion, highlighting significant opportunities for improvement in
enterprise-focused AI systems.

### [12] [Reasoning Models Sometimes Output Illegible Chains of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27338)
*Arun Jose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于结果强化学习的语言模型通过思维链推理表现优异，但研究发现RL训练会导致思维链对人类和AI监控器变得不清晰，尽管最终答案仍然可读。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究思维链的可读性对于理解模型意图和检测恶意行为至关重要，但需要思维链清晰且忠实。

Method: 分析了14个推理模型的思维链可读性，比较RL训练前后的变化，并通过强制使用清晰部分和重采样来测试可读性与性能的关系。

Result: RL训练导致思维链变得不清晰，模型使用不清晰推理仍能得出正确答案（准确率下降53%），但可读性与性能在重采样中无相关性，且难题的可读性更差。

Conclusion: 如果没有明确优化可读性，基于结果的RL自然会产生推理过程不透明的模型，可能破坏监控方法的有效性。

Abstract: Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to
reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance.
Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and
detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires
that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning
models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both
humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating
illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show
that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping
by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation
between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the
relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder
questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including
steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest
that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally
produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially
undermining monitoring approaches.

### [13] [Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27484)
*Uzay Macar,Paul C. Bogdan,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出通过重采样方法研究推理模型的多条思维链分布，而非单一思维链，以进行可靠的因果分析。通过案例研究展示了该方法在评估原因的实际影响、比较策略干预效果、分析推理步骤重要性以及理解暗示的累积影响等方面的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常只分析单一思维链，但模型实际上定义了多条可能思维链的分布。仅研究单一样本不足以理解因果影响和底层计算过程，需要研究整个分布来获得可靠分析。

Method: 使用重采样方法研究模型决策：1）通过重采样特定句子测量其下游影响；2）比较策略内重采样与策略外干预的效果；3）引入弹性度量防止相似内容重现；4）改编因果中介分析研究暗示的累积影响。

Result: 研究发现：1）自我保护句子的因果影响很小；2）策略外干预效果小且不稳定；3）关键规划语句难以移除但移除后影响大；4）暗示对输出有因果影响但不明确提及，通过思维链施加微妙累积影响。

Conclusion: 通过重采样研究分布能够实现可靠的因果分析、更清晰的模型推理叙述和原则性的思维链干预，为理解模型推理提供了更全面的方法。

Abstract: Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single
chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many
possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for
understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully
specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.
We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,
when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause
the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences
to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small
causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are
artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in
literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a
completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We
find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to
resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of
removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce
a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from
reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have
large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can
our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation
analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without
being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT
that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via
resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model
reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.

*Alireza Saleh Abadi,Leen-Kiat Soh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文对多智能体强化学习中的开放系统进行了概念性和实证性回顾，重点关注开放性与信用分配问题之间的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多智能体强化学习中开放系统的动态性至关重要，因为传统的信用分配方法假设静态环境，无法适应开放系统中智能体、任务和类型的动态变化。

Method: 首先进行概念分析，引入新的开放性子类别，然后使用代表性的时间和结构算法在开放环境中进行实证研究。

Result: 研究表明开放性直接导致信用错误分配，表现为不稳定的损失函数和显著的性能下降。

Conclusion: 开放环境中的信用分配问题比传统静态环境更加复杂，需要开发新的方法来应对智能体、任务和类型的动态变化。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers
to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a
system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et
al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at
any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or
disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents
change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,
focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem
(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the
overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open
environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static
agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making
them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,
in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent
turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental
stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We
then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural
algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness
directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and

TL;DR: 提出了CATArena评估平台，通过无上限分数的棋盘和纸牌游戏来持续评估LLM智能体的学习能力，解决了现有基准测试中的分数饱和问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试主要评估固定场景下的端到端性能，存在分数饱和和对专家标注依赖的问题，无法有效评估智能体的学习能力这一核心进化驱动力。

Method: 提出了迭代式竞争性同伴学习框架，让智能体通过重复交互和反馈来优化策略，并开发了CATArena平台，包含四种棋盘和纸牌游戏，采用无上限评分机制。

Result: 实验结果表明CATArena能够为智能体核心能力（特别是学习能力和策略编码）提供可靠、稳定和可扩展的基准测试。

Conclusion: CATArena平台有效解决了现有基准测试的局限性，为评估智能体学习能力提供了系统化的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to
autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools.
However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed
scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score
saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities
improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability,
including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent
evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive
peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their
strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically
evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue
in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation
platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring.
By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables
continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities.
Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code
agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable
benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and
strategy coding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出自适应努力控制方法，让用户通过连续参数动态控制AI模型的推理努力程度，实现成本-准确性的权衡，相比标准方法减少约3倍思维链长度同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要用户预先指定绝对token数量，但用户难以事先知道问题难度来合理设置token预算。用户需要根据输出质量与延迟/成本的权衡来精细控制推理努力程度。

Method: 自适应强化学习方法，训练模型使用用户指定的相对于当前平均思维链长度的token比例，无需数据集和阶段特定的调优。

Result: 在1.5B到32B参数规模的模型上，该方法能实现约3倍思维链长度减少，同时保持或改善相对于RL训练基础模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了用户对AI模型推理努力程度的精细控制需求，实现了更好的成本-准确性权衡曲线。

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve
accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may
prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they
value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff
effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used
for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing
methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but
this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately
set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains
models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current
average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates
dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy
tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the
cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at
inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate
resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales
ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x
reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance
relative to the base model used for RL training.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了在NVIDIA企业AI助手NVInfo中实施数据飞轮的实际案例，通过MAPE驱动的闭环系统解决RAG管道故障并实现持续学习，显著提升了路由和查询重述的准确性和延迟性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业AI代理需要持续适应以保持准确性、降低延迟并与用户需求保持一致，因此需要建立能够从实际使用中学习的自适应系统。

Method: 采用MAPE驱动的数据飞轮方法，构建闭环系统监控RAG管道故障，收集用户反馈数据，并使用NVIDIA NeMo微服务进行针对性微调优化。

Result: 在3个月部署后收集495个负样本，识别出路由错误(5.25%)和查询重述错误(3.2%)。通过微调，路由模型准确率达96%，模型大小减少10倍，延迟改善70%；查询重述准确率提升3.7%，延迟减少40%。

Conclusion: 人类在环反馈结合数据飞轮结构能够将企业AI代理转变为自我改进系统，为构建稳健、自适应的企业AI代理提供了可重复的蓝图。

Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce
latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical
implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a
MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically
addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and
enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we
monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two
major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors
(3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements
through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a
fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,
and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\%
gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how
human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,
transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings
include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,
navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.
This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive
enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了LLMs在数学证明评分方面的能力，包括错误检测、严重性判断和分数分配，并提出了基于智能体工作流程的评分方法以提高与人类评分的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在解决奥林匹克数学问题方面取得显著进展，需要评估它们在证明评分方面的能力，特别是在检测错误、判断严重性和分配公平分数方面的表现。

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的解决方案和MathArena的IMO/USAMO 2025解决方案集进行研究，引入智能体工作流程来提取和分析参考解决方案，自动推导问题特定的评分标准，并进行多步骤评分过程。

Result: 模型能够可靠地标记错误解决方案（包括细微错误），但在部分分数分配方面存在校准差距。提出的工作流程在人类评分一致性和部分分数处理方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 智能体工作流程能够提高证明评分的准确性和一致性，特别是在处理部分分数方面。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the

for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a
human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning,
experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework

ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates
interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a
distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for
request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert
levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload
behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured
experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for
complex systems problems.

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到最先进性能，特别是在跨领域场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在多样化GUI导航任务中保持稳健的推理和泛化能力。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation
agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and
effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that
systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history
summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent
Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning,
which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries
for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent,
\textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled
trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware
objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance.
Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
results under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong
performance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's
ability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI
navigation tasks. Code is available at https://leon022.github.io/GUI-Rise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态信息的复杂性和多样性，让多模态大语言模型在推理过程中灵活高效地使用外部工具仍是一个未充分探索的挑战。

Method: ToolScope包含三个主要组件：全局导航器（提供高层战略指导）、代理执行器（通过集成外部工具迭代增强局部感知）和响应合成器（整合推理过程）。

Result: 在四个VQA基准测试上评估，包括VQA 2.0、ScienceQA、MAT-Search和MathVista，平均性能提升达+6.69%。

Conclusion: ToolScope展示了强大的泛化能力，有效提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools
for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse
nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning
remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an
agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal
perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context
degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary
components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response
Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering
high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to
augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external
tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer
consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly
output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains,
including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up
to +6.69% across all datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏灵活性或忽视感知和运动约束等底层机制，需要更真实的交互模型来理解人类道路使用者行为和开发安全的自动驾驶系统。

Method: 使用多智能体强化学习框架，集成行人和驾驶员的视觉与运动约束，评估四种模型变体（无约束、仅运动约束、仅视觉约束、两者皆有）。

Result: 结合视觉和运动约束的模型表现最佳，运动约束产生更平滑的运动，视觉约束引入感知不确定性导致更谨慎的行为，在数据有限情况下优于监督学习模型。

Conclusion: 带有人类约束的多智能体强化学习是模拟真实道路使用者交互的有前景方法，能够考虑个体差异并有效处理小数据集场景。

Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human
road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing
approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or
'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack
flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor
constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in
interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of
pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised
pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,
two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across
behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined
model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints
lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during
crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual
uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more
cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this
data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning
model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training
datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by
modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level
distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on
pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that
multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for
simulating realistic road user interactions.

Method: 提出Socratic协作范式，训练Nous智能体主动探询信息以解决用户意图不确定性，基于信息理论框架，将对话信息增益作为内在奖励信号。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决复杂人机协作中的用户意图不确定性提供了原则性、可扩展且自适应的范式。

Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the "intention
expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex,
high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in
inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise
levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to
a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for
information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed
agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core
mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of
information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from
dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to
the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward
design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or
external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated
simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the
challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,
including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across
user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to
varying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show
evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results
prove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for
resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 大型推理模型存在认知效率问题：对简单问题'过度思考'，对复杂问题'思考不足'。现有方法使用SFT或带长度奖励的RL来提高效率，但往往以牺牲准确性为代价。

Method: DeepCompress采用自适应长度奖励机制，实时将问题动态分类为'简单'或'困难'，对简单问题鼓励短推理链，对困难问题促进长推理链。

Conclusion: DeepCompress框架能够同时提升大型推理模型的准确性和效率，通过自适应调整推理链长度来优化模型性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but
suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and
``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised
fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can
improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper
introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously
enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing
approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer
responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult
problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that
dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on
the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient
reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory
thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the
model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing
reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds
challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show
that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理改进方法存在局限性：临时生成的数据集可能包含偏差且无法验证，而Lean等证明系统虽然可验证但不适合捕捉基于决策链的任务特性。

Method: 使用两个评估基准：TTE测试LLM理解和模拟多步推理系统执行的能力，TCE测试LLM进行多步因果推理和从复杂系统中提取因果关系的能力。

Result: 模型在TCE-normal上得分65.6%，在TCE-hard上仅得7.5%，表明最先进LLM能理解TCE任务但随着系统复杂性增加表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在复杂推理任务上仍存在明显局限性，需要更系统化的评估方法来衡量和改进其推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human
performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers
either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems
such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture
the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some
inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be
formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee
verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic
decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for
functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of
LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or
real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and
verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically
analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks
to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests
the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given
multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)
tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill
cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score
65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art
LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity
increases. Our code is available at our

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to
relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current
retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow
inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information
from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge
Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that
orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted
searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent
generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic
perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and
computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as
MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms
both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance

TL;DR: 提出了InnovatorBench基准测试平台，用于评估AI代理在LLM研究中的端到端表现，包含20个任务和ResearchGym研究环境，实验显示前沿模型在代码驱动任务中表现良好但在算法相关任务和长期决策中存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在简化环境中评估狭窄技能，需要更真实的端到端评估平台来加速AI代理在科学研究中的自动化应用。

Method: 开发了InnovatorBench基准测试平台和ResearchGym研究环境，包含20个研究任务，实现轻量级ReAct代理结合前沿模型进行推理和可执行规划。

Result: 前沿模型在代码驱动研究任务中表现良好，但在脆弱算法相关任务和长期决策制定方面存在困难，代理需要超过11小时才能达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: InnovatorBench展示了作为下一代基于代码的研究基准的潜力，突显了AI代理在科学研究自动化中的挑战和机遇。

Abstract: AI agents could accelerate scientific discovery by automating hypothesis
formation, experiment design, coding, execution, and analysis, yet existing
benchmarks probe narrow skills in simplified settings. To address this gap, we
introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end
assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It
comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss
Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable
artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and
uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research
environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon
execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a
lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable
planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2.
Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in
code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks
and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management,
and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over
11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the
benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the
next generation of code-based research benchmark.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriMoA是一个无需训练的多智能体框架，通过质量引导缓存和多路径生成策略，显著提升硬件描述语言生成性能，在多个基准测试中实现15-30%的Pass@1改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在HDL生成中面临参数知识有限和领域特定约束的挑战，而多智能体方法存在噪声传播和推理空间受限的问题。

Method: 提出质量引导缓存机制维护所有中间HDL输出，并采用多路径生成策略利用C++和Python作为中间表示，将规范到HDL的转换分解为两阶段过程。

Result: 在VerilogEval 2.0和RTLLM 2.0基准测试中，VeriMoA实现了15-30%的Pass@1改进，使较小模型能够匹配较大模型和微调替代方案。

Conclusion: VeriMoA通过协同创新有效解决了多智能体方法的局限性，为HDL生成提供了无需训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet
increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to
limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt
engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training
costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance
reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent
approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise
propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a
training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic
innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all
intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across
the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers
of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and
Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL
translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource
languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves
15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially
enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives
without requiring costly training.

TL;DR: BEAT框架首次实现了在基于MLLM的具身智能体中注入视觉后门攻击，使用环境中的物体作为触发条件，攻击成功率高达80%，同时保持良性任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示多模态大语言模型(MLLM)具身智能体面临的新安全风险——视觉后门攻击，当视觉触发器出现在场景中时，智能体会持续执行攻击者指定的多步策略。

Method: BEAT框架通过(1)构建跨越多样化场景、任务和触发器放置的训练集，(2)采用两阶段训练方案：监督微调(SFT)和对比触发器学习(CTL)，将触发器判别建模为偏好学习问题。

Result: 在各种具身智能体基准测试和MLLM中，BEAT实现高达80%的攻击成功率，保持强健的良性任务性能，并能可靠泛化到分布外触发器放置。CTL在有限后门数据下将后门激活准确率提升高达39%。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了基于MLLM的具身智能体中关键但未被探索的安全风险，强调了在现实世界部署前需要强大的防御机制。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by
enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from
visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack
surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a
visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an
attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to
inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in
the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit
wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant
reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that
spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger
variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning
(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between
trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision
boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent
benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while
maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to
out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL
boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.
These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based
embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world
deployment.

*Sebastian Benthall,Andrew Clark*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Agentic AI的新现实主义定义，将其视为一种软件交付机制，类似于SaaS，能够在复杂企业环境中自主运行应用程序。作者强调Agentic AI主要是应用而非基础模型，其成功取决于终端用户和主要利益相关者的验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，Agentic AI受到广泛关注，但现有定义不够清晰。作者旨在提供一个更准确的定义，并强调验证的重要性，而非仅仅依赖基础模型。

Method: 通过分析现有Agentic AI定义，提出新的现实主义定义，并讨论验证工具和技术与基础模型评估的区别。

Result: 确立了Agentic AI作为软件交付机制的定义，指出在良好验证措施下，基础模型可以被更简单、快速、可解释的模型替代。

Conclusion: Agentic AI的成功关键在于验证，而非基础模型本身。LLMs只是实现验证的一种可能选择。

Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science,
today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of
Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software
delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an
application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven
excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are
primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on
validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques
needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite
different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models.
Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the
foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more
interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI,
validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.

TL;DR: Apollo是一个集成异步人类指导与动作级数据过滤的采样框架，用于训练LLM代理处理长视野、领域专业化任务，相比传统方法显著提升了训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前训练LLM代理的方法存在两个主要问题：基于密集人工标注的行为克隆成本过高，而基于结果驱动的采样方法在领域专业化任务中由于有效轨迹稀少而容易失败。

Method: Apollo框架允许人类仅在代理偏离有前景轨迹时进行干预，提供先验知识和策略建议，同时应用监督控制来过滤次优动作并防止错误传播。

Result: 在InnovatorBench上的实验表明，Apollo使GLM-4.5模型相比未训练基线提升了50%以上，相比无人交互训练变体提升了28%。

Conclusion: Apollo证明了人类在环采样在长视野、领域专业化任务中的关键作用，其设计在处理这类任务时具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in
domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface
manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall
into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through
behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that
can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which
often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on
domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that
integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.
Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to
intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing
prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it
possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable
trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter
out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these
components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon
environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using
InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5
model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the
untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human
interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop
sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在COBOL等遗留语言现代化应用中，面临专家资源和高质量人工评估数据短缺的问题。虽然LaaJ提供了可扩展的替代方案，但其可靠性需要验证，否则可能导致循环评估风险，影响下游部署决策。

Method: 提出SparseAlign框架，结合新颖的成对置信度概念和分数敏感对齐指标，共同捕捉排名一致性和分数接近度，在有限标注示例下实现可靠的评估器选择。

Result: SparseAlign在内部应用于COBOL代码解释的LaaJ选择，将最对齐的评估器集成到评估工作流中，指导模型发布决策。通过四个LaaJ的案例研究展示了其在实际评估场景中的实用性。

Conclusion: SparseAlign为在稀疏人工标注数据下验证LaaJ与人类判断对齐提供了有效的解决方案，解决了传统方法在数据有限情况下的局限性。

Abstract: Application modernization in legacy languages such as COBOL, PL/I, and REXX
faces an acute shortage of resources, both in expert availability and in
high-quality human evaluation data. While Large Language Models as a Judge
(LaaJ) offer a scalable alternative to expert review, their reliability must be
validated before being trusted in high-stakes workflows. Without principled
validation, organizations risk a circular evaluation loop, where unverified
LaaJs are used to assess model outputs, potentially reinforcing unreliable
judgments and compromising downstream deployment decisions. Although various
automated approaches to validating LaaJs have been proposed, alignment with
human judgment remains a widely used and conceptually grounded validation
strategy. In many real-world domains, the availability of human-labeled
evaluation data is severely limited, making it difficult to assess how well a
LaaJ aligns with human judgment. We introduce SparseAlign, a formal framework
for assessing LaaJ alignment with sparse human-labeled data. SparseAlign
combines a novel pairwise-confidence concept with a score-sensitive alignment
metric that jointly capture ranking consistency and score proximity, enabling
reliable evaluator selection even when traditional statistical methods are
ineffective due to limited annotated examples. SparseAlign was applied
internally to select LaaJs for COBOL code explanation. The top-aligned
evaluators were integrated into assessment workflows, guiding model release
decisions. We present a case study of four LaaJs to demonstrate SparseAlign's
utility in real-world evaluation scenarios.

Motivation: REST API是现代云原生系统的核心，确保其可靠性需要自动化测试套件。但设计多样化和边界级别的测试用例仍然具有挑战性且资源密集。

Method: 扩展了基于LLM的测试放大方法，评估了单智能体和多智能体配置在四个云应用中的表现，通过最小人工干预保持语义有效性。

Result: 智能体LLM系统能有效泛化到异构API架构，提高端点和参数覆盖率，同时发现缺陷。详细分析了计算成本、运行时间和能耗之间的权衡。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的测试放大方法有潜力推进复杂云环境中REST API测试的自动化和可持续性。

Abstract: Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are a cornerstone of modern cloud
native systems. Ensuring their reliability demands automated test suites that
exercise diverse and boundary level behaviors. Nevertheless, designing such
test cases remains a challenging and resource intensive endeavor. This study
extends prior work on Large Language Model (LLM) based test amplification by
evaluating single agent and multi agent configurations across four additional
cloud applications. The amplified test suites maintain semantic validity with
minimal human intervention. The results demonstrate that agentic LLM systems
can effectively generalize across heterogeneous API architectures, increasing
endpoint and parameter coverage while revealing defects. Moreover, a detailed
analysis of computational cost, runtime, and energy consumption highlights
trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and efficiency. These findings
underscore the potential of LLM driven test amplification to advance the
automation and sustainability of REST API testing in complex cloud
environments.

Result: 自动化基准测试显示不同模型在指令遵循的多个维度上表现出不同水平的性能

Conclusion: 该基准测试管道提供了对代码生成模型更全面的评估，突出了它们在不同语言和生成目标上的优势和局限性

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable of generating code,
evaluating their performance remains a complex and evolving challenge. Existing
benchmarks primarily focus on functional correctness, overlooking the diversity
of real-world coding tasks and developer expectations. To this end, we
introduce a multi-language benchmark that evaluates LLM instruction-following
capabilities and is extensible to operate on any set of standalone coding
problems. Our benchmark evaluates instruction following in two key settings:
adherence to pre-defined constraints specified with the initial problem, and
the ability to perform refinements based on follow-up instructions. For this
paper's analysis, we empirically evaluated our benchmarking pipeline with
programming tasks from LiveBench, that are also automatically translated from
Python into Java and JavaScript. Our automated benchmark reveals that models
exhibit differing levels of performance across multiple dimensions of
instruction-following. Our benchmarking pipeline provides a more comprehensive
evaluation of code generation models, highlighting their strengths and
limitations across languages and generation goals.
