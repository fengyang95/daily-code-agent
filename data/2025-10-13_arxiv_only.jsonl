This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional,\nGUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction\nparadigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate\ntheir objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions\nacross multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However,\nextant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which\nintroduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For\nlanguage-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface\nparadigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative.\nThis limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of\nlocally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational\ncomponents for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine\nthe capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating\nuser intention resolution through machine assistance.

Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance\nsafety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we\nintroduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework\ndesigned to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time\nintervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to\nassign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low\nenergy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,\nEBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an \"energy landscape\". We use the\ngradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to\nlow energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in\nreal-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral\ncontrol from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with\nminimal computational overhead.

To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis\nfrom the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the\nfeatures of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.\nConcretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,\nexhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency\nbands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor\nsimilarity.

However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two\ncritical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific\nfeatures, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the\noutput, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic\nalignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets,\nresulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original\nsource. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured\nInstruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT\nconsists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the\nsyntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic\nsyntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality\nfine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation\nmodule aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and\ncontrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction\ntuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused\nby the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs\nsyntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend\nstructured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code\ngeneration fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code\nbased on function-level syntactic dependencies.

Our study shows that GPT-5 performed\nthe best on average in each category, while other models displayed more\ninconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &\nAutonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with\naverages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages\nof 1.39 and 1.98, respectively.

Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the\nfairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image\ndiagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked\nprognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression\nof a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,\nthe first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)\nprediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging\nmodalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and\nfairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness\nin medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE\nuncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical\nimaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive\nacross different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer\nlimited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between\nunderlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for\nholistic approaches that target all forms of bias.

Yet this\nloss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\\em Do CL and NSCL also remain\naligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their\nobjectives?}\n  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL\nmodels trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and\naugmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain\nsimilar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL\nstay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability\nguarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and\nrepresentational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment\nimproves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch\nsize.

In recent years, leveraging\nembeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language\nmodels (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame\ninduction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama\nseries succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage\nin dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to\nsemantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction\nbased on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for\nobtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing\nthe given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we\nleverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame\ninduction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.\nExperimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate\nthat the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods.

As a proof\nof concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but\nuninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate\nthis dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures\nthe optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize\nthis framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to\ncompute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of\nblack-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for\nstakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in\nresource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM\necosystems."}

By using\nunique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,\nthis dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,\nbilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This\ntechnique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct\nmodel for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon\nthe pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to\nLlama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading\nmultilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,\nand Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our\nresults demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be\ndeveloped efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct\napproach.

In this\nwork, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a\nconstant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.\nSpecifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a\nDeep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents\nrepresentational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit\nboth the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of\none-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment\nbetween negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or\nnon-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with\nVAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as\na drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.\nEmpirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and\nsubstantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model\nbackbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify\ntwo major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding\nand practical performance."}

Our main result shows that the local minimax\nrisk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class\n$\\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,\nwe (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP\nframework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler\nyields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.\nBuilding on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the\nlocally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of\n$f$-divergence.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework\ndesigned to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time\nintervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to\nassign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low\nenergy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,\nEBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an \"energy landscape\".

They\nwork under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to\npre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about\nhow to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the\nhardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base\ngenerative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward\noracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning\nchallenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose\nBaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the\nmodel using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward\nevaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of\nlearning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop\ngenerative modeling problem.

In\norder to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we\nshow that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random\nsampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When\ncomparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25\nexamples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to\nbe preserved.
