Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often\ninduces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true\nobjectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves\nlearning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over\npairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and\ncorrect for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a\nnew preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a\ncumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based\nRL methods.

To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third\nmode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary\nreasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes.

We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,\nwhich treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which\ngeometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive\ntight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between\nthe model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under\ngradient descent (GD) updates.

Prior research\nhas shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a\ndecision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier\naccuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification\ncontext, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and\nhow principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a\nStackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces\nits decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate\ntheir features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary\nclassifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true\nfeatures, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility\n(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of\nstrategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can\nalso serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents,\nespecially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome\nwhen manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior.

In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to\nsynthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming\nspectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast\nenhancement techniques.

However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording\nnecessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,\nleading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this\nstorage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system\ndesigned to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded\nmobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We\nidentify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user\nbehavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across\ndifferent features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing\nbehaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To\nsolve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level\nredundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and\nproposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,\nAdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous\nbehaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to\nensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an\nincremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting\noutdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into\npopular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner.

Most existing deep\nlearning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,\nneglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,\nwe propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP\nframework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture\ncomprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder\nbased on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable\nBERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared\nlatent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance\nefficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where\nthe trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student\nmodel to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT\ndatasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding\n97%.

Two predominant approaches are based on Adam\nand Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current\ngradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter\nuses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the\nrecent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.\n  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through\nthe lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the\nimpact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these\noptimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four\nquadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where\nAdam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings.\nConversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for\nlinear regression under a Gaussian data assumption.
