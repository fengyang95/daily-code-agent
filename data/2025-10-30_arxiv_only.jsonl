We present Fortytwo, a\nnovel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed\npairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our\napproach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a\npeer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that\nsurfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom\nBradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference\nsubstantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond\nversus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of\n+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol\nincorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated\naccuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality\nor malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs\nproof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete\ncalibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making\nmulti-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.\nAcross six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and\nAIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to\nadversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation\nof only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while\nretaining practical deployability.

In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization\nstrategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.\nFirstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational\nconsumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define\nthem as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian\noptimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation\nwhile maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in\nvarious traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to\ndistinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust\ndecision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning\nand design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of\nperturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of\nour framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can\nreduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by\n3.9% to 8.5%"}

Despite its theoretical\nappeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of\nautonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal\noption termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that\nintegrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)\nmodule into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of\nstate trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained\nusing heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent\nshifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred\nchange-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory\nsignals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain\nintra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce\nfunctional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over\nCPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the\nstandard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our\nframework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments\nare mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to\nautonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful\nskills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that\nCPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,\nand significantly improved option specialization.

This approach accelerates\nCoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.\nHowever, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)\nthey fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning\n(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,\nresulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on\nreducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the\nconsiderable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning\ntoken.

Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families.

Therefore, this study constructs and\nvalidates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat\nRescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming\napproach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct\nLLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,\nModerate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and\nparaphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited\ntranscripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic\ndegradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,\nword count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on\nthe results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune\nmodels for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and\nusefulness of the synthetic transcripts."}

The\ngoverning partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often\nintractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,\ncharacterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with\nincomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven\nmethods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are\noften physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing\nphysics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex\noperators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we\npropose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally\nadvances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of\nphysical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level\narchitecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level\nlearns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their\ngoverning combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces\nlearning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of\nprior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models\ncomputational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data\nefficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,\nwe can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators\ncharacteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling\nknown and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery\nof underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without\npresupposing functional forms."}

This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext.

In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such\nas the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We\npropose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in\nreal-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the\noptimum.

Despite this industry\ntrend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying\ngranularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design\nwithout clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically\ninvestigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical\nperformance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the\ncomparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our\ncomprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained\nformats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart\nin both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit\nformats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we\nshow that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like\nHadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method\nthat resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling\nnearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the\ncurrent hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach\nis suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly\nMXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI\naccelerators."}

We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual\nknowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to\n13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from\nACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as\ncommunication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior\nFramework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and\ntests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive\nframing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation\npatterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.\nOur results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge\nrecall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness\ninversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB\nprovides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and\noverall behavior in LLMs."}

To support this shift, we introduce\ncollaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility\ngrows with increasing user involvement.

For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path\ncan be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal\nreasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is\nthis the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it\navoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for\nexplanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a\nquestion to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to\nderive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove\nthat conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled\nreasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided\nVariational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned\nreasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning.

This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing\na novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two\ndistinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and\npersistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation\nand prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of\n90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around\nthis framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and\narchitectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific\nimplementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how\napplication constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific\nethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation\nstrategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:\nsymbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while\nneural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).\nFurthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant\ndeficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for\nhybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic\nroadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one\nparadigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both\nadaptable and reliable.

In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of\nthe available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference\nrequires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for\nassessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,\nintroducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as\ngenerated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic\nprogram. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids\nunnecessary inference.

Preprint submitted to ACM Transactions on\n  Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), 2025", "summary": "Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization\nservices. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should\nmake rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default,\nwithout blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers\nface a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low\ncoding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default including\nversioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs,\nand recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models,\nmetrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing\ntools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization\nworkflows in particular. In this paper we introduce LOCALIZE, a low-code,\nconfiguration-first framework for radio localization in which experiments are\ndeclared in human-readable configuration, a workflow orchestrator runs\nstandardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts,\nsuch as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. The\npreconfigured, versioned datasets reduce initial setup and boilerplate,\nspeeding up model development and evaluation. The design, with clear extension\npoints, allows experts to add components without reworking the infrastructure.\nIn a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter\nnotebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while\nmaintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a\nBluetooth Low Energy dataset, we show that scaling across training data (1x to\n10x) keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows. Overall, the\nframework makes reproducible machine-learning-based localization\nexperimentation practical, accessible, and extensible."}
