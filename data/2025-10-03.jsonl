While recent advances in\nlarge language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain\ninaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,\npre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we\nargue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,\nwhere AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than\nstatic datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,\nparticularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond\nstatic data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven\ndiscovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration\ninstead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework\ngrounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty\nfrom the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers\nto guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention.

However, their exponentially\nincreasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on\nresource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for\nlow-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key\nchallenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed\nalong the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses\nerror expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which\nconstructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to\ndynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally\noptimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints.

These methods fail to capture the\nemergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,\npersuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a\ncontrolled \"social laboratory\" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our\nframework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and\nincentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the\nsupervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of\npsychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across\nhundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for\nagents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\\mu}\n> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show\nthat assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,\nparticularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can\nsignificantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key\nfinding for external AI alignment.

In this paper, we present\nRLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the\ncore spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of\npretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory\naction, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for\npredicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the\nmodel to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an\nindependent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the\nreward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when\nconditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to\nconditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense\nreward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream\nduring pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for\nreasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between\nnext-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.\nPretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an\neight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%.

While conventional model-based control strategies, such as\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their\nreliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.\nThis tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free\nReinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely\nfrom observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit\nstructural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training\nmust occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,\nduring this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it\nexerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the\nstructure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies\non an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations\nindicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model\noutperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce\na hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this\napproach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its\nparameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an\napproximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This\nhybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while\nminimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations.

In large language models,\nsemantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,\nwhile episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers\ntend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this\nphenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,\nentropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall\nbehavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and\nmonotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable\nacross various tasks and domains.

The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day\nbilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent\ninteraction phases.

This is because, just as a human\ncounselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate\nsufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a\nrole. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in\nU.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional\ncounselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises\napproximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to\nrequire deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of\npsychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's\nability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models\nsuch as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing\nthreshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)\nremain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are\ncurrently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the\npromise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs."}

In this work, we show that pairing\nLLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model\nbehavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the\ntraining data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels\nof Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We\nthen apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,\ninterpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in\nthe corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings\ndemonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into\ncomplex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,\nand model interpretability at scale."}

We\nfocus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and\ncritic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of\nstrong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work\nshows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft\nActor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites\ninvolve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to\nsharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing\nin cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This\nreveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into\nalgorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues\nbehind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that\ninduce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy\ncoevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model\nvariance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes\nenables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to\noutperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance\npreviously reported in OpenAI Gym.

Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This\napproach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between\ncomplex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

In the first stage, we\nleverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which\nis then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we\nintroduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output\nand the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning\neffectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across\ndiverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and\nLLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently\nachieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,\nvalidating its effectiveness and generalization."}

Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial\nprojections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden\nstates. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical\nfeatures that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly\nalign with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper\nexplores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We\nshow that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable\nsignature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we\npresent Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately\nminimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only\nsummarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies\ncorrectness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''\nclusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights\nthe strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently\noutperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern\nconfidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and\nmajority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24\nwith a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%\n(top-maj@16)."}

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

Measuring Knowledge-Aware Refusal in Factual Tasks", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their\nknowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial\nfor factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure\nthis ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by\nrefusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different\nrefusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are\nproxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes\nrather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the\nRefusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs\nrefuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation\nbetween refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically\nmeasurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently\nestimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.\nExtensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI\naccurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in\nfactual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and\nprovides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy\nand refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but\npreviously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high\naccuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and\nfragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy\nmetrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation."}

This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free\ncross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are\ncompletely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware\ndynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled\nsource-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is\nbuilt upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale\nvision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal\ngeneralizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain\nshift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a\nfrequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while\nsuppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware\naugmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label\nproblem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy\nwhere the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,\nthus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the\nissue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant\nanalysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification\nis performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the\nrandom kernel method.

In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to\ndiagnose reasoning-execution gaps.

By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)\nmetric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.\nThis joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)\nExecution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action\nbut execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but\nreasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results\nacross a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution\ngaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than\nreasoning gaps.

For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge\nvariants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore\nstructured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection\ntasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we\npropose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an\nobjective summarization over extensive evaluation settings."}

While diffusion models have achieved\nremarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous\nGaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework\nfor jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond\nunification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and\nprincipled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited\nfor posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion\nposterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields\nsparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs\nsamplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked\ndiffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized\nexpectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and\nanchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear\nand nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further\ndemonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and\ntext-guided editing."}

Through this approach, we can adopt an\noptimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are\nobtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step\nsizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation\nperformance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on\nImageNet 256$\\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and\nsample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework\nthat naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD\ndetection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with\na unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and\nenergy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference."}

However, the\nmechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially\nunderstood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes\nthis success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure\nwithin the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on\nhow such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem\nthrough score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by\ninvestigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score\nmatching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that\nsmoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density\ndomain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we\nshow that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be\ncontrolled by choosing an appropriate smoothing."}

Robertson", "Gal Mishne", "Alexander Cloninger"], "title": "Robust Tangent Space Estimation via Laplacian Eigenvector Gradient Orthogonalization", "comment": null, "summary": "Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in\ndata analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis\n(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in\nchoosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior\nknowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often\nunavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector\nGradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the\ndata to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on\nlocal neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by\northogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph\nLaplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a\ndifferential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows\nthat gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align\nclosely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high\ngradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.\nSecond, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency\neigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are\nsignificantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked\nimprovements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,\nand local intrinsic dimension estimation."}

Under Review", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with\nexplicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant\ncomputational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic\nartifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that\ninternalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of\nsupervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning\ntraces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this\ngap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher\ninto a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the\nrepresentational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV\ntrajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within\ncompressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a\nrich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the\napproach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly\nsmaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales\nto larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish\ncompressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent\nreasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency\nand deployability of latent inference."}
