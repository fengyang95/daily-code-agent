Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures.

We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives.

This addresses a critical\nand open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy\nconstraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem\nby introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for\ntraining to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first\nproxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance\nmeasures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of\nthese metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that\nleverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies\ncorrelate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment\nanalysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS\nconsistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced\ncharacteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3\nsynthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to\n38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately.

In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to\ncapture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended\nconcept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned\nprobes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close\nto that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a\nnovel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and\nprovide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization\ntechniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further\npropose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept\nalignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our\nanalysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment\nconsistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for\nalignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the\nimportance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of\nthe target concept."}

Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable\nfrom human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.\nInstruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up\nmodel size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:\noptimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and\nvice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for\nvalidation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note\nabout their current limitations in capturing human communication."}

Furthermore, our method employs\na batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,\noptimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on\ndata relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language\npairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that\nour method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared\nto an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves\ncomputational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires\nfewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting\nin superior translation performance compared to random selection method."}

WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable.

In this paper, we investigate whether generative models\ntrained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce\nairports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and\nflow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their\ntransferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory\ndatasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying\namounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that\ndiffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of\nthe Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently\noutperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual\ninspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from\npretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show\nweaker generalization.

Numerical Weather\nPrediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for\nrapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models\nsuffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based\nmethods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate\nreconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully\nthree-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar\nreflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with\ndatadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields\nunder a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying\ndiffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to\nrepresent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective\ninitiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic\nmodule estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up\nto three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\\%\nof cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D\ndynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for\nskillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation."}

Addressing this\nproblem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades\nof study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the\nunderlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic\ntheory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a\nlearner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a\nloss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure\nof an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a\ncomprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,\ngenerative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate\nhow forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant\nrole in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a\nprincipled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and\nimproving the information retention capabilities of general learning\nalgorithms."}

Classical Test Theory analysis\nreveals that 55\\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \\geq 0.40$)\nwhile 30\\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.\nQuestion 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful\ndiscriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA\nF-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance\n(0.206), accounting for 20.6\\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms\ndemonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting\nachieving 97.5\\% and 96.0\\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering\nidentifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\\%,\ndiverging from the institutional threshold of 55\\% and suggesting potential\noverclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits\nexceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster\npurity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:\nreplace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and\nintegrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These\nfindings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical\nfoundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization."}
