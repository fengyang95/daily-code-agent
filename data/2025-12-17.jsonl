However, the corresponding models often operate as black boxes, leading them to unintentionally act unfairly towards different demographic groups. This has led to a growing focus on fairness in AI software recently, alongside the traditional focus on the effectiveness of AI models. Through 26 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from different application domains and with varied backgrounds across 23 countries, we conducted research on fairness requirements in AI from software engineering perspective. Our study assesses the participants' awareness of fairness in AI / ML software and its application within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from translating fairness concerns into requirements to assessing their arising early in the SDLC. It also examines fairness through the key assessment dimensions of implementation, validation, evaluation, and how it is balanced with trade-offs involving other priorities, such as addressing all the software functionalities and meeting critical delivery deadlines. Findings of our thematic qualitative analysis show that while our participants recognize the aforementioned AI fairness dimensions, practices are inconsistent, and fairness is often deprioritized with noticeable knowledge gaps. This highlights the need for agreement with relevant stakeholders on well-defined, contextually appropriate fairness definitions, the corresponding evaluation metrics, and formalized processes to better integrate fairness into AI/ML projects."}

However, the effectiveness of tool use depends heavily on the quality of the associated documentation and knowledge base context. These materials are usually written for human users and are often misaligned with how LLMs interpret information. This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements. Third, they enable cost-efficient sub-task specialization, either by prompt engineering large editor models or by post-training smaller editor models. Unlike prior work that emphasizes multi-turn reasoning, VGCO focuses on the single-turn, large-scale tool-calling problem and achieves significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across LLMs."}

Recent studies demonstrate an average 39% performance drop when instructions are delivered across multiple turns, with models making premature assumptions and failing to course correct (Laban et al., 2025). This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path. Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context.\n  We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions. ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights. We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations. Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness. Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations. Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content. Our work establishes conversation branching as a fundamental primitive for AI-assisted exploratory work, demonstrating that isolation prevents context pollution when exploring alternatives."}

The promise of agents is that developers might write code quicker, delegate multiple tasks to different agents, and even write a full piece of software purely out of natural language. In reality, what roles agents play in professional software development remains in question. This paper investigates how experienced developers use agents in building software, including their motivations, strategies, task suitability, and sentiments. Through field observations (N=13) and qualitative surveys (N=99), we find that while experienced developers value agents as a productivity boost, they retain their agency in software design and implementation out of insistence on fundamental software quality attributes, employing strategies for controlling agent behavior leveraging their expertise. In addition, experienced developers feel overall positive about incorporating agents into software development given their confidence in complementing the agents' limitations. Our results shed light on the value of software development best practices in effective use of agents, suggest the kinds of tasks for which agents may be suitable, and point towards future opportunities for better agentic interfaces and agentic use guidelines."}

Our experiments show that the regression model achieves more than 84 F1, and that models trained on FiNERweb obtain comparable or improved performance in zero shot transfer settings on English, Thai, and Swahili, despite being trained on 19x less data than strong baselines. In addition, we assess annotation quality using LLM-as-a-judge and observe consistently high scores for both faithfulness (3.99 out of 5) and completeness (4.05 out of 5), indicating reliable and informative annotations. Further, we release the dataset with both English labels and translated label sets in the respective target languages because we observe that the performance of current state-of-the-art models drops by 0.02 to 0.09 F1 when evaluated using target language labels instead of English ones. We release FiNERweb together with all accompanying artifacts to the research community in order to facilitate more effective student-teacher training for multilingual named entity recognition."}

In this work, we introduce PerfCoder, a family of LLMs specifically designed to generate performance-enhanced code from source code via interpretable, customized optimizations. PerfCoder is fine-tuned on a curated collection of real-world optimization trajectories with human-readable annotations, and preference-aligned by reinforcement fine-tuning using runtime measurements, enabling it to propose input-specific improvement strategies and apply them directly without relying on iterative refinement. On the PIE code performance benchmark, PerfCoder surpasses all existing models in both runtime speedup and effective optimization rate, demonstrating that performance optimization cannot be achieved by scale alone but requires optimization stratetgy awareness. In addition, PerfCoder can generate interpretable feedback about the source code, which, when provided as input to a larger LLM in a planner-and-optimizer cooperative workflow, can further improve outcomes. Specifically, we elevate the performance of 32B models and GPT-5 to new levels on code optimization, substantially surpassing their original performance."}

However, conventional construction methods demand extensive location-labeled data, which are costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper presents a blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel measurements without relying on location labels. It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories. Experiments on a ray-tracing dataset demonstrate an average localization error of 0.68 m and a beam map reconstruction error of 3.3%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed blind mapping method."}

Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for automation, existing applications rely on simplistic prompting without task decomposition or domain adaptation, resulting in unreliable black-box behavior and limited insight into model capabilities across penetration testing stages. To address this gap, we introduce PentestEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across six decomposed penetration testing stages: Information Collection, Weakness Gathering and Filtering, Attack Decision-Making, Exploit Generation and Revision. PentestEval integrates expert-annotated ground truth with a fully automated evaluation pipeline across 346 tasks covering all stages in 12 realistic vulnerable scenarios. Our stage-level evaluation of 9 widely used LLMs reveals generally weak performance and distinct limitations across the stages of penetration-testing workflow. End-to-end pipelines reach only 31% success rate, and existing LLM-powered systems such as PentestGPT, PentestAgent, and VulnBot exhibit similar limitations, with autonomous agents failing almost entirely. These findings highlight that autonomous penetration testing demands stronger structured reasoning, where modularization enhances each individual stage and improves overall performance. PentestEval provides the foundational benchmark needed for future research on fine-grained, stage-level evaluation, paving the way toward more reliable LLM-based automation."}

The method introduces a candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling to achieve unified modeling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies. The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability. This study verifies the effectiveness of structure-aware decoding in complex semantic extraction tasks, provides a new perspective for developing language models with hierarchical understanding, and establishes a methodological foundation for high-precision information extraction."}

First, we analyze the model behavior of Qwen-2.5 family (1.5B-32B) and find that while the number of effective layers grows with model size, the effective depth ratio remains stable. Besides, comparisons between base and corresponding long-CoT models show no increase in effective depth, suggesting that improved reasoning stems from longer context rather than deeper per-token computation. Furthermore, evaluations across tasks of varying difficulty indicate that models do not dynamically use more layers for harder problems. Our results suggest that current LLMs underuse available depth across scales, training paradigms and tasks of varying difficulties, pointing out research opportunities on increasing the layer utilization rate of LLMs, model pruning, and early exiting.

We demonstrate this approach through Teralizer, a prototype for Java that transforms JUnit tests into property-based jqwik tests. Unlike prior work that generalizes from input-output examples, Teralizer derives specifications from program semantics.\n  We evaluated Teralizer on three progressively challenging datasets.

Generalization of mature developer-written tests from Apache Commons utilities showed only 0.05-0.07 percentage points improvement. Analysis of 632 real-world Java projects from RepoReapers highlights applicability barriers: only 1.7% of projects completed the generalization pipeline, with failures primarily due to type support limitations in symbolic analysis and static analysis limitations in our prototype. Based on the results, we provide a roadmap for future work, identifying research and engineering challenges that need to be tackled to advance the field of test generalization.\n  Artifacts available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17950381"}

To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively."}

This study combines Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with environmental and hydrological data to model flood susceptibility in the River Nyando watershed, western Kenya. Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR data from the May 2024 flood event were processed to produce a binary flood inventory, which served as training data for machine learning (ML) models. Six conditioning factors -- slope, elevation, aspect, land use/land cover, soil type, and distance from streams -- were integrated with the SAR-derived flood inventory to train four supervised classifiers: Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results indicate that RF achieved the highest predictive performance (accuracy = 0.762; Kappa = 0.480), outperforming LR, CART, and SVM. The RF-based susceptibility map showed that low-lying Kano Plains near Lake Victoria have the highest flood vulnerability, consistent with historical flood records and the impacts of the May 2024 event. These findings demonstrate the value of combining SAR data and ensemble ML methods for flood susceptibility mapping in regions with limited data. The resulting maps offer important insights for disaster risk reduction, land-use planning, and early warning system development."}

These reliability issues restrict safe use of LLM in areas that need the precision of facts and consistent behavior (Aiyappa et al., 2023). The current methods of stabilization, such as, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and supervised fine-tuning, offer quantifiable improvements but are expensive and based on the intensive annotation of humans, thus being not easily scaled in a sustainable way (Dong et al., 2023; Retzlaff et al., 2024). This paper presents an AI-based annotation pipeline that systematically identifies, labels, and fixes for instability patterns on LLM output. Our human-AI synergy method combines the models of automated weak supervision and confidence-based annotation with the target human validation to guarantee the reliability and moral uprightness of feedback information (Cabitza et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). The semantic consistency, factual correctness, and logical coherence categories of stability-specific annotation are introduced into our framework, allowing the continuous calibration of models and the enhancement of their robustness based on the feedback loops (Honovich et al., 2021; Nan et al., 2021)."}

This study introduces the Model of Things (MoT), a model-based approach that incorporates low-code principles to simplify CoT development. MoT reduces technical barriers by providing a custom UML profile designed for IoT and cloud services. To evaluate MoT, we conducted a case study and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The results confirmed MoT's feasibility, demonstrating that it streamlines CoT application development and deployment. Users found MoT accessible, even with limited IoT experience, and reported high perceived ease of use and usefulness. Qualitative feedback highlighted MoT's ability to reduce complexity and speed up development. MoT offers a promising, model-driven solution for CoT application development. By lowering entry barriers and promoting automation, it enhances both efficiency and flexibility.

However, the core self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with sequence length, creating a fundamental computational bottleneck. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate this issue but face trade-offs: training-based methods are costly and cannot be directly applied as acceleration plugins for other models, while inference-time methods often compromise efficiency or cross-modal generality. To address these limitations, we present UniSparse, a unified mechanism that introduces the notion of composite tokens--compact representations that aggregate multi-granularity contextual information. Building on this abstraction, UniSparse dynamically constructs sparse attention through multi-granularity compression and block-level selection, enabling efficient and hardware-friendly execution on GPU. Across multiple modalities and tasks ranging from synthetic benchmarks to real-world applications, UniSparse consistently surpasses state-of-the-art sparse attention methods (e.g., MInference, XAttention, FlexPrefill) in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving $\\ge$ 99% of full-attention accuracy and up to 2.61$\\times$ faster attention computation than FlashAttention."}

While much progress has been made in unlearning for LLMs, document classification models remain relatively understudied. In this paper, we study class-level unlearning for document classifiers and present Hessian Reassignment, a two-step, model-agnostic solution. First, we perform a single influence-style update that subtracts the contribution of all training points from the target class by solving a Hessian-vector system with conjugate gradients, requiring only gradient and Hessian-vector products. Second, in contrast to common unlearning baselines that randomly reclassify deleted-class samples, we enforce a decision-space guarantee via Top-1 classification. On standard text benchmarks, Hessian Reassignment achieves retained-class accuracy close to full retrain-without-class while running orders of magnitude faster. Additionally, it consistently lowers membership-inference advantage on the removed class, measured with pooled multi-shadow attacks. These results demonstrate a practical, principled path to efficient class unlearning in document classification."}

The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Additional ablation and scalability studies confirm the method's robustness, achieving up to 40% faster adaptation and consistent fairness, latency, and throughput performance as network scale increases."}

As these systems scale, sustainability concerns have intensified, with most assessments focusing on model architecture, hardware efficiency, and deployment infrastructure. However, existing mitigation efforts largely overlook how user interaction practices themselves shape the energy profile of LLM based systems. In this vision paper, we argue that interaction level behavior appears to be an underexamined factor shaping the environmental impact of LLM based systems, and we present this issue across four dimensions. First, extended conversational patterns increase token production and raise the computational cost of inference. Second, expectations of instant responses limit opportunities for energy aware scheduling and workload consolidation. Third, everyday user habits contribute to cumulative operational demand in ways that are rarely quantified. Fourth, the accumulation of context affects memory requirements and reduces the efficiency of long running dialogues. Addressing these challenges requires rethinking how chatbot interactions are designed and conceptualized, and adopting perspectives that recognize sustainability as partly dependent on the conversational norms through which users engage with LLM based systems."}

The model is Transformer-based and operates at the frame level, jointly trained with auxiliary tasks on approximately 300 hours of dyadic conversations. Across all three languages, the multilingual model matches or surpasses monolingual baselines, indicating that it learns both language-universal cues and language-specific timing patterns. Zero-shot transfer with two-language training remains limited, underscoring substantive cross-lingual differences. Perturbation analyses reveal distinct cue usage: Japanese relies more on short-term linguistic information, whereas English and Chinese are more sensitive to silence duration and prosodic variation; multilingual training encourages shared yet adaptable representations and reduces overreliance on pitch in Chinese. A context-length study further shows that Japanese is relatively robust to shorter contexts, while Chinese benefits markedly from longer contexts. Finally, we integrate the trained model into a real-time processing software, demonstrating CPU-only inference. Together, these findings provide a unified model and empirical evidence for how backchannel timing differs across languages, informing the design of more natural, culturally-aware spoken dialogue systems."}

The dataset combined weekly hospitalization rates, wastewater RSV levels, daily meteorological measurements, and air pollutant concentrations. Classification models, including CART, Random Forest, and Boosting, were trained to predict weekly RSV-associated hospitalization rates classified as \\textit{Low risk}, \\textit{Alert}, and \\textit{Epidemic} levels.

Further research is needed to better understand the drivers of RSV disparity in these communities to improve prevention strategies. Furthermore, states at high altitudes, characterized by lower surface pressure, showed consistently higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates. These findings highlight the value of combining environmental and community surveillance data to forecast RSV outbreaks, enabling more timely public health interventions and resource allocation.

Human values serve as stable, transferable signals that support consistent and generalizable behavior across contexts. Compared to task-oriented paradigms driven by external rewards and incentives, value-driven decision-making enhances interpretability and enables agents to act appropriately even in novel scenarios. We introduce ValuePilot, a two-phase framework consisting of a dataset generation toolkit (DGT) and a decision-making module (DMM). DGT constructs diverse, value-annotated scenarios from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline. DMM learns to evaluate actions based on personal value preferences, enabling context-sensitive, individualized decisions.

We introduce CogMem, a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture that supports sustained iterative reasoning through structured, persistent memory. CogMem incorporates three layers: a Long-Term Memory (LTM) that consolidates cross-session reasoning strategies; a Direct Access (DA) memory that maintains session-level notes and retrieves relevant long-term memories; and a Focus of Attention (FoA) mechanism that dynamically reconstructs concise, task-relevant context at each turn.

In clinical practice, EEG data are often scarce, patient-specific distributed across institutions, and governed by strict privacy regulations that prohibit data pooling. As a result, creating usable AI-based seizure detection models remains challenging in real-world medical settings. To address these constraints, we propose a two-stage federated few-shot learning (FFSL) framework for personalized EEG-based seizure detection. The method is trained and evaluated on the TUH Event Corpus, which includes six EEG event classes. In Stage 1, a pretrained biosignal transformer (BIOT) is fine-tuned across non-IID simulated hospital sites using federated learning, enabling shared representation learning without centralizing EEG recordings. In Stage 2, federated few-shot personalization adapts the classifier to each patient using only five labeled EEG segments, retaining seizure-specific information while still benefiting from cross-site knowledge. Federated fine-tuning achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.43 (centralized: 0.52), Cohen's kappa of 0.42 (0.49), and weighted F1 of 0.69 (0.74). In the FFSL stage, client-specific models reached an average balanced accuracy of 0.77, Cohen's kappa of 0.62, and weighted F1 of 0.73 across four sites with heterogeneous event distributions.

As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness. This work provides an initial empirical map of compressed causal reasoning and practical guidance for deploying efficient and structurally supported causal AI systems."}

To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\\% compared to baseline methods.

Critically, this RAG approach enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to outperform much larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B), demonstrating that a well-designed retrieval strategy can be more crucial than model size. This work contributes an effective, fine-tuning-free solution for low-resource dialect translation, offering a practical blueprint for preserving linguistic diversity."}

Adaptive delayed matching creates a trade-off between matching and pickup delays by deciding whether to assign drivers immediately or batch requests. Since outcomes accumulate over long horizons with stochastic dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) is a suitable framework. However, existing approaches often oversimplify traffic dynamics or use shallow encoders that miss complex spatiotemporal patterns.\n  We introduce the Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which formalizes adaptive delayed matching as a regime-aware MDP equipped with a self-attention MoE encoder. Unlike monolithic networks, our experts specialize automatically, improving representation capacity while maintaining computational efficiency. A physics-informed congestion surrogate preserves realistic density-speed feedback, enabling millions of efficient rollouts, while an adaptive reward scheme guards against pathological strategies.\n  With only 12M parameters, our framework outperforms strong baselines. On real-world Uber trajectory data (San Francisco), it improves total reward by over 13%, reducing average matching and pickup delays by 10% and 15% respectively. It demonstrates robustness across unseen demand regimes and stable training. These findings highlight the potential of MoE-enhanced RL for large-scale decision-making with complex spatiotemporal dynamics."}

For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task. The results show an improvement compared to the results obtained using only the original corpus without artificial expansion, and also demonstrate that economic embeddings often perform better than some LLMs."}

Acquiring such high-resolution wind data, however, remains a challenging and expensive endeavour. Traditional reconstruction approaches are typically either cost-effective or accurate, but not both. Deep learning methods, including diffusion models, have been proposed to resolve this trade-off by leveraging advances in natural image super-resolution. Wind data, however, is distinct from natural images, and wind super-resolvers often use upwards of 10 input channels, significantly more than the usual 3-channel RGB inputs in natural images. To better leverage a large number of conditioning variables in diffusion models, we present a generalization of classifier-free guidance (CFG) to multiple conditioning inputs. Our novel composite classifier-free guidance (CCFG) can be dropped into any pre-trained diffusion model trained with standard CFG dropout. We demonstrate that CCFG outputs are higher-fidelity than those from CFG on wind super-resolution tasks.

Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive."}

To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents.

This challenge is ubiquitous in fields such as fluid mechanics, seismic inversion, and structural health monitoring. Existing deep and operator-learning models collapse under these conditions: fixed-grid assumptions fail, reconstruction deteriorates sharply, and inversion becomes unreliable with limited robustness and no uncertainty quantification (UQ).We propose the Physical Inversion Solver (PIS), a set-conditioned diffusion framework enabling inversion from truly arbitrary observation sets. PIS employs a Set Transformer-based encoder to handle measurements of any number or geometry, and a cosine-annealed sparsity curriculum for exceptional robustness. An accompanying information-theoretic analysis provides insight into the limits of inversion under extreme sparsity by revealing how observation entropy varies across physical systems.PIS is evaluated on three challenging PDE inverse problems: Darcy flow, wavefield inversion (Helmholtz), and structural health monitoring (Hooke's Law). Across all tasks and sparsity regimes -- including extreme cases with an observation rate of only $0.29\\%$ -- existing operator-learning baselines fail to reconstruct meaningful fields, often diverging or collapsing entirely.In stark contrast, PIS remains stable and accurate, reducing inversion error by $12.28\\%$--$88.73\\%$ and reliably producing calibrated posterior samples. These samples accurately reflect both data scarcity and intrinsic physical ambiguity. These results position PIS as a powerful, general-purpose, and uniquely sparsity-resilient solution for physical inversion under arbitrary and severely undersampled observations."}

To this end, we propose MURIM, a MUlti-dimensional Reputation-based Incentive Mechanism that jointly considers client reliability, privacy, resource capacity, and fairness while preventing malicious or unreliable clients from earning undeserved rewards. MURIM allocates incentives based on client contribution, latency, and reputation, supported by a reliability verification module. Extensive experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and ADULT Income datasets demonstrate that MURIM achieves up to 18% improvement in fairness metrics, reduces privacy attack success rates by 5-9%, and improves robustness against poisoning and noisy-gradient attacks by up to 85% compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Overall, MURIM effectively mitigates adversarial threats, promotes fair and truthful participation, and preserves stable model convergence across heterogeneous and dynamic federated settings."}

Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation.

Current methods either rely on heuristics that can yield sub-optimal results due to their limited discrete search space or are gradient-based but are not as performant as heuristic approaches without post-compression fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose Learning to Low-Rank Compress (LLRC), a gradient-based approach which directly learns the weights of masks that select singular values in a fine-tuning-free setting. Using a calibration dataset, we train only the mask weights to select fewer and fewer singular values while minimising the divergence of intermediate activations from the original model. Our approach outperforms competing ranking selection methods that similarly require no post-compression fine-tuning across various compression rates on common-sense reasoning and open-domain question-answering tasks. For instance, with a compression rate of 20% on Llama-2-13B, LLRC outperforms the competitive Sensitivity-based Truncation Rank Searching (STRS) on MMLU, BoolQ, and OpenbookQA by 12%, 3.5%, and 4.4%, respectively.

We segment the model's reasoning into steps, identify the steps corresponding to reflection, and extract a reflection direction in the latent space that governs this behavior. Using this direction, we propose a stepwise steering method that can control reflection frequency. We call our framework ReflCtrl. Our experiments show that (1) in many cases reflections are redundant, especially in stronger models (in our experiments, we can save up to 33.6 percent of reasoning tokens while preserving performance), and (2) the model's reflection behavior is highly correlated with an internal uncertainty signal, implying self-reflection may be controlled by the model's uncertainty."}

While Top-p routing offers a flexible alternative, existing implementations typically rely on a fixed global probability threshold, which results in uncontrolled computational costs and sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose DTop-p MoE, a sparsity-controllable dynamic Top-p routing mechanism. To resolve the challenge of optimizing a non-differentiable threshold, we utilize a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller that dynamically adjusts the probability threshold to align the running activated-expert sparsity with a specified target. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic routing normalization mechanism that adapts layer-wise routing logits, allowing different layers to learn distinct expert-selection patterns while utilizing a global probability threshold. Extensive experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers demonstrate that DTop-p consistently outperforms both Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines. Our analysis confirms that DTop-p maintains precise control over the number of activated experts while adaptively allocating resources across different tokens and layers. Furthermore, DTop-p exhibits strong scaling properties with respect to expert granularity, expert capacity, model size, and dataset size, offering a robust framework for large-scale MoE pre-training."}

Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models.

However, the process of labeling MDD remains challenging. As a self-supervised learning method, contrastive learning could address the shortcomings of supervised learning methods, which are unduly reliant on labels in the context of MDD detection. However, existing contrastive learning methods are not specifically designed to characterize the time-frequency distribution of EEG signals, and their capacity to acquire low-semantic data representations is still inadequate for MDD detection tasks. To address the problem of contrastive learning method, we propose a time-frequency fusion and multi-domain cross-loss (TF-MCL) model for MDD detection. TF-MCL generates time-frequency hybrid representations through the use of a fusion mapping head (FMH), which efficiently remaps time-frequency domain information to the fusion domain, and thus can effectively enhance the model's capacity to synthesize time-frequency information. Moreover, by optimizing the multi-domain cross-loss function, the distribution of the representations in the time-frequency domain and the fusion domain is reconstructed, thereby improving the model's capacity to acquire fusion representations. We evaluated the performance of our model on the publicly available datasets MODMA and PRED+CT and show a significant improvement in accuracy, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 5.87% and 9.96%, respectively."}

Current defense strategies often rely on computationally expensive external classifiers or brittle lexical filters, overlooking the intrinsic dynamics of the model's reasoning process. In this work, the Laminar Flow Hypothesis is introduced, which posits that benign inputs induce smooth, gradual transitions in an LLM's high-dimensional latent space, whereas adversarial prompts trigger chaotic, high-variance trajectories - termed Semantic Turbulence - resulting from the internal conflict between safety alignment and instruction-following objectives. This phenomenon is formalized through a novel, zero-shot metric: the variance of layer-wise cosine velocity. Experimental evaluation across diverse small language models reveals a striking diagnostic capability. The RLHF-aligned Qwen2-1.5B exhibits a statistically significant 75.4% increase in turbulence under attack (p less than 0.001), validating the hypothesis of internal conflict. Conversely, Gemma-2B displays a 22.0% decrease in turbulence, characterizing a distinct, low-entropy \"reflex-based\" refusal mechanism. These findings demonstrate that Semantic Turbulence serves not only as a lightweight, real-time jailbreak detector but also as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for categorizing the underlying safety architecture of black-box models."}

However, the substantial computational demand restricts access to LLM almost exclusively through cloud-based service, which makes LLM-based decision support tools impractical for dairy farming. To address this gap, lightweight alternatives capable of running locally on farm hardware are required. In this work, we benchmarked 20 open-source Small Language Models (SLM) available on HuggingFace under farm-realistic computing constraints. Building on our prior work, we developed an agentic AI system that integrates five task-specific agents: literature search, web search, SQL database interaction, NoSQL database interaction, and graph generation following predictive models. Evaluation was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, five test questions were used for the initial screening to identify models capable of following basic dairy-related instructions and performing reliably in a compute-constrained environment. Models that passed this preliminary stage were then evaluated using 30 questions (five per task category mentioned above, plus one category addressing integrity and misconduct) in phase two. In results, Qwen-4B achieved superior performance across most of task categories, although showed unstable effectiveness in NoSQL database interactions through PySpark. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly evaluating the feasibility of SLM as engines for dairy farming decision-making, with central emphases on privacy and computational efficiency. While results highlight the promise of SLM-assisted tools for practical deployment in dairy farming, challenges remain, and fine-tuning is still needed to refine SLM performance in dairy-specific questions."}

This study provides a comparative evaluation of embedding-based methods for financial news sentiment classification in resource-constrained environments.

Experimental results identify a substantial gap between validation and test performance, with models performing worse than trivial baselines despite strong validation metrics.

Practical application is illustrated through weekly sentiment aggregation and narrative summarization for market monitoring workflows.

Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings. Furthermore, ICoT outperforms six existing prompting baselines on challenging benchmarks."}

Existing parameter-efficient approaches such as pruning and quantization mainly compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, thereby hitting the representational ceiling of the base model. In this work, we propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network (FFN) that enables flexible reuse of parameters in both width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget. Inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition, VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN, mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways, steering \"easy\" tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating deeper iterative refinement to \"hard\" tokens. Crucially, both pathways reuse the same parameters, so all additional capacity comes from computation rather than memory. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

We introduce Memory-Infused Depth Up-Scaling (MIDUS), which replaces FFNs in duplicated blocks with a head-wise memory (HML) layer. Motivated by observations that attention heads have distinct roles both across and within layers, MIDUS assigns an independent memory bank to each head, enabling head-wise retrieval and injecting information into subsequent layers while preserving head-wise functional structure. This design combines sparse memory access with head-wise representations and incorporates an efficient per-head value factorization module, thereby relaxing the usual efficiency-performance trade-off. Across our CPT experiments, MIDUS exhibits robust performance improvements over strong DUS baselines while maintaining a highly efficient parameter footprint. Our findings establish MIDUS as a compelling and resource-efficient alternative to conventional FFN replication for depth up-scaling by leveraging its head-wise memory design."}

However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation. Rather than merely expanding a leaderboard, ODA envisions a shift from trial-and-error data curation to a principled science of Data-Centric AI, paving the way for rigorous studies on data mixing laws and the strategic composition of foundation models."}

In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal ratio between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal ratio is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance."}

To address this, we propose MV-SupGCN, a semi-supervised GCN model that integrates several complementary components with clear motivations and mutual reinforcement. First, to better capture discriminative features and improve model generalization, we design a joint loss function that combines Cross-Entropy loss with Supervised Contrastive loss, encouraging the model to simultaneously minimize intra-class variance and maximize inter-class separability in the latent space.

Third, to effectively utilize abundant unlabeled data and enhance semantic alignment across multiple views, we propose a unified framework that integrates contrastive learning in order to enforce consistency among multi-view embeddings and capture meaningful inter-view relationships, together with pseudo-labeling, which provides additional supervision applied to both the cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions to enhance model generalization.

A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods. Zero-shot transfer to 100 Environment and Climate Change Canada stations yields F1 = 0.586, exceeding all baselines and demonstrating cross-national generalization. The model maintains consistent detection across correction magnitudes and aligns with operational seasonal patterns. HydroGEM is designed for human-in-the-loop workflows - outputs are quality control suggestions requiring expert review, not autonomous corrections."}

The framework instruction-tunes compact chat models using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization under a resource-adaptive training setup. A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data. The proposed framework provides an efficient and reproducible approach for survey data generation, supporting scalable evaluation while facilitating bias analysis through transparent and open protocols."}

However, despite the convincing benchmark performance, successful translation to real applications is limited. The frequent disconnect between performance on controlled BCI benchmarks and its lack of generalisation to practical settings indicates hidden overfitting problems. We introduce Disentangled Decoding Decomposition (D3), a weakly supervised method for training deep learning models across EEG datasets. By predicting the place in the respective trial sequence from which the input window was sampled, EEG-D3 separates latent components of brain activity, akin to non-linear ICA. We utilise a novel model architecture with fully independent sub-networks for strict interpretability. We outline a feature interpretation paradigm to contrast the component activation profiles on different datasets and inspect the associated temporal and spatial filters. The proposed method reliably separates latent components of brain activity on motor imagery data. Training downstream classifiers on an appropriate subset of these components prevents hidden overfitting caused by task-correlated artefacts, which severely affects end-to-end classifiers. We further exploit the linearly separable latent space for effective few-shot learning on sleep stage classification. The ability to distinguish genuine components of brain activity from spurious features results in models that avoid the hidden overfitting problem and generalise well to real-world applications, while requiring only minimal labelled data. With interest to the neuroscience community, the proposed method gives researchers a tool to separate individual brain processes and potentially even uncover heretofore unknown dynamics."}

However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation.

In particular, it is observed in the literature that LMs tuned by RLHF can still output unsatisfactory responses. This paper proposes a method to improve the unsatisfactory responses by correcting their causes. Our method has two parts. The first part proposes a post-hoc explanation method to explain why an unsatisfactory response is generated to a prompt by identifying the training data that lead to this response. We formulate this problem as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to find a set of training data closest to this prompt-response pair in a feature representation space, and the constraint is that the prompt-response pair can be decomposed as a convex combination of this set of training data in the feature space. We propose an efficient iterative data selection algorithm to solve this problem. The second part proposes an unlearning method that improves unsatisfactory responses to some prompts by unlearning the training data that lead to these unsatisfactory responses and, meanwhile, does not significantly degrade satisfactory responses to other prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can improve RLHF."}

However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages. Our approach outperforms existing baselines with an average, across datasets, of 65% of records within a 10 km radius, for a fixed amount of training data. The best results (New York state) were 85% within 10km and 67% within 1km. The selected LLM performs well for lengthy, complex descriptions, highlighting its potential for georeferencing intricate locality descriptions."}

To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community.

However, many NLP pipelines only require models with a well-defined, small set of capabilities. While large models are capable of performing the tasks of those smaller models, they are simply not fast enough to process large amounts of data or offer real-time responses. Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages. We call our models TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) and comprehensively evaluate them on a range of common NLP tasks, observing an improved trade-off between benchmark performance on one hand, and throughput, latency and energy consumption on the other.

The process of removing connections from a network at random is similar to percolation, a paradigm model of statistical physics.\n  If dropout were to remove enough connections such that there is no path between the input and output of the NN, then the NN could not make predictions informed by the data. We study new percolation models that mimic dropout in NNs and characterise the relationship between network topology and this path problem. The theory shows the existence of a percolative effect in dropout.

The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.\n  Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.\n  X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.\n  Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement.

Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency.

Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method."}

We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models."}

One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement. On an NVIDIA H100, OPTIMA prunes a 8B-parameter transformer end-to-end in 40 hours with 60GB peak memory.

However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions.

However, empirical evidence suggests that such long-context LLMs can consume far more text than they can reliably use. On the other hand, it has been shown that inference-time compute can be used to scale performance of LLMs, often by generating thinking tokens, on challenging tasks involving multi-step reasoning. Through controlled experiments on sandbox long-context tasks, we find that such inference-time strategies show rapidly diminishing returns and fail at long context. We attribute these failures to score dilution, a phenomenon inherent to static self-attention. Further, we show that current inference-time strategies cannot retrieve relevant long-context signals under certain conditions. We propose a simple method that, through targeted gradient updates on the given context, provably overcomes limitations of static self-attention. We find that this shift in how inference-time compute is spent leads to consistently large performance improvements across models and long-context benchmarks. Our method leads to large 12.6 and 14.1 percentage point improvements for Qwen3-4B on average across subsets of LongBench-v2 and ZeroScrolls benchmarks. The takeaway is practical: for long context, a small amount of context-specific training is a better use of inference compute than current inference-time scaling strategies like producing more thinking tokens."}

Accurate precipitation forecasts are vital for society. Reliable predictions help communities mitigate climatic impacts. Based on the current relevance of artificial intelligence (AI), classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been used as an alternative or complement to dynamic modeling. However, there is still a lack of broad investigations into the feasibility of purely data-driven approaches for precipitation forecasting. This study aims at addressing this issue where different classical ML and DL approaches for forecasting precipitation in South America, taking into account all 2019 seasons, are considered in a detailed investigation. The selected classical ML techniques were Random Forests and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), while the DL counterparts were a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN 1D), a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. Additionally, the Brazilian Global Atmospheric Model (BAM) was used as a representative of the traditional dynamic modeling approach. We also relied on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to provide some explanations for the models behaviors. LSTM showed strong predictive performance while BAM, the traditional dynamic model representative, had the worst results. Despite presented the higher latency, LSTM was most accurate for heavy precipitation. If cost is a concern, XGBoost offers lower latency with slightly accuracy loss. The results of this research confirm the viability of DL models for climate forecasting, solidifying a global trend in major meteorological and climate forecasting centers."}

Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \\emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \\emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \\emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines \"minimal sufficient sets\" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains."}

Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter."}

Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains.

To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_φ$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks.

Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively.

However, achieving exact invariance to specific symmetries typically requires designing bespoke architectures for each group of symmetries, limiting scalability and preventing knowledge transfer across related symmetries. In the case of the space groups, symmetries critical to modeling crystalline solids in materials science and condensed matter physics, this challenge is particularly salient as there are 230 such groups in three dimensions. In this work we present a new approach to such crystallographic symmetries by developing a single machine learning architecture that is capable of adapting its weights automatically to enforce invariance to any input space group. Our approach is based on constructing symmetry-adapted Fourier bases through an explicit characterization of constraints that group operations impose on Fourier coefficients. Encoding these constraints into a neural network layer enables weight sharing across different space groups, allowing the model to leverage structural similarities between groups and overcome data sparsity when limited measurements are available for specific groups. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving competitive performance on material property prediction tasks and performing zero-shot learning to generalize to unseen groups."}

However, compared to the more widely studied MHC-I in computational immunotherapy, the study of MHC-II antigenic epitope poses significantly more challenges due to its complex binding specificity and ambiguous motif patterns. Consequently, existing datasets for MHC-II interactions are smaller and less standardized than those available for MHC-I. To address these challenges, we present a well-curated dataset derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and other public sources. It not only extends and standardizes existing peptide-MHC-II datasets, but also introduces a novel antigen-MHC-II dataset with richer biological context. Leveraging this dataset, we formulate three major machine learning (ML) tasks of peptide binding, peptide presentation, and antigen presentation, which progressively capture the broader biological processes within the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway. We further employ a multi-scale evaluation framework to benchmark existing models, along with a comprehensive analysis over various modeling designs to this problem with a modular framework.

To overcome this limitation, we propose the Hybrid Symmetric Positive-Definite Manifold Graph Neural Network (HSMGNN), a novel graph neural network-based model that captures data geometry within a hybrid Euclidean-Riemannian framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage hybrid geometric representations for MTS forecasting, enabling expressive and comprehensive modeling of geometric properties. Specifically, we introduce a Submanifold-Cross-Segment (SCS) embedding to project input MTS into both Euclidean and Riemannian spaces, thereby capturing spatio-temporal variations across distinct geometric domains. To alleviate the high computational cost of Riemannian distance, we further design an Adaptive-Distance-Bank (ADB) layer with a trainable memory mechanism. Finally, a Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (FGCN) is devised to integrate features from the dual spaces via a learnable fusion operator for accurate prediction.

Existing approaches are often tailored to single tasks or specific data types, making it difficult to simultaneously handle multi-task modeling and effectively integrate information across diverse time series types. Moreover, real-world data are often affected by noise, complex frequency components, and multi-scale dynamic patterns, which further complicate robust feature extraction and analysis. To ameliorate these challenges, we propose FusAD, a unified analysis framework designed for diverse time series tasks. FusAD features an adaptive time-frequency fusion mechanism, integrating both Fourier and Wavelet transforms to efficiently capture global-local and multi-scale dynamic features. With an adaptive denoising mechanism, FusAD automatically senses and filters various types of noise, highlighting crucial sequence variations and enabling robust feature extraction in complex environments.

Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel \"token rounding\" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE.

A DIFNO is an FNO trained by minimizing its prediction error jointly on output and Fréchet derivative samples of a high-fidelity operator (e.g., a parametric PDE solution operator). As a result, a DIFNO can closely emulate not only the high-fidelity operator's response but also its sensitivities. To motivate the use of DIFNOs instead of conventional FNOs as surrogate models, we show that accurate surrogate-driven PDE-constrained optimization requires accurate surrogate Fréchet derivatives. Then, for continuously differentiable operators, we establish (i) simultaneous universal approximation of FNOs and their Fréchet derivatives on compact sets, and (ii) universal approximation of FNOs in weighted Sobolev spaces with input measures that have unbounded supports. Our theoretical results certify the capability of FNOs for accurate derivative-informed operator learning and accurate solution of PDE-constrained optimization. Furthermore, we develop efficient training schemes using dimension reduction and multi-resolution techniques that significantly reduce memory and computational costs for Fréchet derivative learning.

Instead of relying on heuristic reward estimation, our method leverages formal logical consistency to steer model alignment with human preferences. Since real-world questions can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, to ensure that logic-based reinforcement learning does not cause model collapse, we introduce S-GRPO, a supervised variant of the GRPO framework.

Among various optimization-based attacks, the gradient-based PGD and the momentum-based MI-FGSM have garnered considerable interest.

In this paper, we first reveal that PGD is actually a specific reformulation of the projected gradient method using only the current gradient to determine its step-size. Further, we show that when we utilize a conventional adaptive matrix with the accumulated gradients to scale the perturbation, PGD becomes AdaGrad. Motivated by this analysis, we present a novel momentum-based attack AdaMI, in which the perturbation is optimized with an interesting momentum-based adaptive matrix. AdaMI is proved to attain optimal convergence for convex problems, indicating that it addresses the non-convergence issue of MI-FGSM, thereby ensuring stability of the optimization process.

A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty. Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations. An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes. To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems. LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information. As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \\geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$. Thirdly, we show that LLM compare is robust to hallucinations, with less than $6\\%$ degradation in Pearson correlation for $10\\%$ noise injection.

Building on a regularization-based framework for structured model learning, we focus on learning parameterized reaction terms and investigate how to incorporate key physical properties, such as mass conservation and quasipositivity, directly into the learning process. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose techniques to systematically modify a given class of parameterized reaction terms such that the resulting terms inherently satisfy mass conservation and quasipositivity, ensuring that the learned RD systems preserve non-negativity and adhere to physical principles. These modifications also guarantee well-posedness of the resulting PDEs under additional regularity and growth conditions. Second, we extend existing theoretical results on regularization-based model learning to RD systems using these physically consistent reaction terms. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the learning problem converge to a unique, regularization-minimizing solution of a limit system even when conservation laws and quasipositivity are enforced. In addition, we provide approximation results for quasipositive functions, essential for constructing physically consistent parameterizations. These results advance the development of interpretable and reliable data-driven models for RD systems that align with fundamental physical laws."}

As a practical demonstration of our methodology, we present a comprehensive evaluation of two state-of-the-art Graph Generative Models: Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRAN) and Efficient and Degree-guided graph GEnerative model (EDGE). We investigate their performance in generating realistic graphs and compare them using a Geometric Deep Learning model trained on a custom dataset of synthetic and real-world graphs, specifically designed for graph classification tasks.

We study this phenomenon in classical Hopfield networks and show they can infer the full isomorphism class of a graph from a small random sample. Our results reveal that: (i) graph isomorphism classes can be represented within a three-dimensional invariant subspace, (ii) using gradient descent to minimize energy flow (MEF) has an implicit bias toward norm-efficient solutions, which underpins a polynomial sample complexity bound for learning isomorphism classes, and (iii) across multiple learning rules, parameters converge toward the invariant subspace as sample sizes grow. Together, these findings highlight a unifying mechanism for generalization in Hopfield networks: a bias toward norm efficiency in learning drives the emergence of approximate invariance under group-structured data."}

In contrast to state-of-the-art causal discovery methods that model the problem using discrete-time Dynamic Bayesian networks, our formulation is grounded in Difference-based causal models, which allow milder assumptions for modeling the continuous nature of the system. CaDyT leverages exact Gaussian Process inference for modeling the continuous-time dynamics which is more aligned with the underlying dynamical process. We propose a practical instantiation that identifies the causal structure via a greedy search guided by the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle. Our experiments show that CaDyT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both regularly and irregularly-sampled data, discovering causal networks closer to the true underlying dynamics."}

Specifically, GRAFT strictly aligns daily-aggregated news, social media, and policy texts with half-hour load, and realizes text-guided fusion to specific time positions via cross-attention during both training and rolling forecasting. In addition, GRAFT provides a plug-and-play external-memory interface to accommodate different information sources in real-world deployment. We construct and release a unified aligned benchmark covering 2019--2021 for five Australian states (half-hour load, daily-aligned weather/calendar variables, and three categories of external texts), and conduct systematic, reproducible evaluations at three scales -- hourly, daily, and monthly -- under a unified protocol for comparison across regions, external sources, and time scales. Experimental results show that GRAFT significantly outperforms strong baselines and reaches or surpasses the state of the art across multiple regions and forecasting horizons.

These constraints present challenges in conducting harmonized multi-center sleep studies and discovering novel, robust biomarkers on shorter timescales. Here, we present AnySleep, a deep neural network model that uses any electroencephalography (EEG) or electrooculography (EOG) data to score sleep at adjustable temporal resolutions. We trained and validated the model on over 19,000 overnight recordings from 21 datasets collected across multiple clinics, spanning nearly 200,000 hours of EEG and EOG data, to promote robust generalization across sites. The model attains state-of-the-art performance and surpasses or equals established baselines at 30-s epochs. Performance improves as more channels are provided, yet remains strong when EOG is absent or when only EOG or single EEG derivations (frontal, central, or occipital) are available. On sub-30-s timescales, the model captures short wake intrusions consistent with arousals and improves prediction of physiological characteristics (age, sex) and pathophysiological conditions (sleep apnea), relative to standard 30-s scoring.

We evaluate the accuracy and robustness of Kinetic-Mamba using both time-decomposition and recursive-prediction strategies. We further assess the extrapolation capabilities of the model on varied out-of-distribution datasets.

Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality. As a proof of concept, the generated EGMs are used for data augmentation in a downstream noninvasive EGM reconstruction task, where moderate augmentation improves estimation performance. These results demonstrate the potential of VAE-based generative modeling to alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI pipelines."}

However, current counterfactual techniques for time series classification are predominantly designed with static data assumptions and focus on generating minimal input perturbations to flip model predictions. This paper argues that such approaches are fundamentally insufficient in clinical recommendation settings, where interventions unfold over time and must be causally plausible and temporally coherent. We advocate for a shift towards counterfactuals that reflect sustained, goal-directed interventions aligned with clinical reasoning and patient-specific dynamics. We identify critical gaps in existing methods that limit their practical applicability, specifically, temporal blind spots and the lack of user-centered considerations in both method design and evaluation metrics. To support our position, we conduct a robustness analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for time series and show that the generated counterfactuals are highly sensitive to stochastic noise. This finding highlights their limited reliability in real-world clinical settings, where minor measurement variations are inevitable. We conclude by calling for methods and evaluation frameworks that go beyond mere prediction changes without considering feasibility or actionability. We emphasize the need for actionable, purpose-driven interventions that are feasible in real-world contexts for the users of such applications."}

This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers.

We systematically investigate non-smooth activation functions, including chaotic, stochastic, and fractal variants, in echo state networks. Through comprehensive parameter sweeps across 36,610 reservoir configurations, we demonstrate that several non-smooth functions not only maintain the Echo State Property (ESP) but outperform traditional smooth activations in convergence speed and spectral radius tolerance. Notably, the Cantor function (continuous everywhere and flat almost everywhere) maintains ESP-consistent behavior up to spectral radii of rho ~ 10, an order of magnitude beyond typical bounds for smooth functions, while achieving 2.6x faster convergence than tanh and ReLU. We introduce a theoretical framework for quantized activation functions, defining a Degenerate Echo State Property (d-ESP) that captures stability for discrete-output functions and proving that d-ESP implies traditional ESP. We identify a critical crowding ratio Q=N/k (reservoir size / quantization levels) that predicts failure thresholds for discrete activations. Our analysis reveals that preprocessing topology, rather than continuity per se, determines stability: monotone, compressive preprocessing maintains ESP across scales, while dispersive or discontinuous preprocessing triggers sharp failures. While our findings challenge assumptions about activation function design in reservoir computing, the mechanism underlying the exceptional performance of certain fractal functions remains unexplained, suggesting fundamental gaps in our understanding of how geometric properties of activation functions influence reservoir dynamics."}

Early identification of patients at risk for deterioration is essential not only for patient care quality monitoring but also for physician care management. However, translating varied data streams into accurate and interpretable risk assessments poses significant challenges due to inconsistent data formats. We develop a multimodal machine learning framework, the Early Warning Index (EWI), to predict the aggregate risk of ICU admission, emergency response team dispatch, and mortality. Key to EWI's design is a human-in-the-loop process: clinicians help determine alert thresholds and interpret model outputs, which are enhanced by explainable outputs using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to highlight clinical and operational factors (e.g., scheduled surgeries, ward census) driving each patient's risk. We deploy EWI in a hospital dashboard that stratifies patients into three risk tiers. Using a dataset of 18,633 unique patients at a large U.S. hospital, our approach automatically extracts features from both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data and achieves C-statistics of 0.796. It is currently used as a triage tool for proactively managing at-risk patients. The proposed approach saves physicians valuable time by automatically sorting patients of varying risk levels, allowing them to concentrate on patient care rather than sifting through complex EHR data. By further pinpointing specific risk drivers, the proposed model provides data-informed adjustments to caregiver scheduling and allocation of critical resources. As a result, clinicians and administrators can avert downstream complications, including costly procedures or high readmission rates and improve overall patient flow."}

Recent research has extended the study of stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) from light-tailed to heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in practice, with clipping emerging as a key technique for controlling heavy-tailed gradients. Extensive theoretical advances have further shown that the oracle complexity of SFOMs depends on the tail index $α$ of the noise. Nonetheless, existing complexity results often cover only the case $α\\in (1,2]$, that is, the regime where the noise has a finite mean, while the complexity bounds tend to infinity as $α$ approaches $1$. This paper tackles the general case of noise with tail index $α\\in(0,2]$, covering regimes ranging from noise with bounded variance to noise with an infinite mean, where the latter case has been scarcely studied. Through a novel analysis of the bias-variance trade-off in gradient clipping, we show that when a symmetry measure of the noise tail is controlled, clipped SFOMs achieve improved complexity guarantees in the presence of heavy-tailed noise for any tail index $α\\in (0,2]$. Our analysis of the bias-variance trade-off not only yields new unified complexity guarantees for clipped SFOMs across this full range of tail indices, but is also straightforward to apply and can be combined with classical analyses under light-tailed noise to establish oracle complexity guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Finally, numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings."}

Project page: https://mybearyzhang.github.io/ipr-1", "summary": "Humans learn by observing, interacting with environments, and internalizing physics and causality. Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. To study this, we introduce a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) benchmark of 1,000+ heterogeneous games that exhibit significant visual domain gaps. Existing approaches, including VLMs and world models, struggle to capture underlying physics and causality since they are not focused on core mechanisms and overfit to visual details. VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on levels from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning, and even surpasses GPT-5 overall. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games. These results support physics-centric interaction as a path to steadily improving physical reasoning. Further demos and project details can be found at https://mybearyzhang.github.io/ipr-1."}
