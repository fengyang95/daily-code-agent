Confidence estimation\nserves as an effective and convenient approach for evaluating these aspects.\nThis paper proposes a confidence analysis and enhancement framework for LLMs\ntailored to code reasoning tasks. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on\nthe confidence reliability of mainstream LLMs across different tasks, and\nfurther evaluate the effectiveness of techniques such as prompt strategy\noptimisation and mathematical calibration (e.g., Platt Scaling) in improving\nconfidence reliability. Our results show that DeepSeek-Reasoner achieves the\nbest performance across various tasks, outperforming other models by up to\n$0.680$, $0.636$, and $13.652$ in terms of ECE, Brier Score, and Performance\nScore, respectively. The hybrid strategy combining the reassess prompt strategy\nand Platt Scaling achieves improvements of up to $0.541$, $0.628$, and $15.084$\nover the original performance in the aforementioned three metrics. These\nresults indicate that models with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior\nconfidence reliability, and that the hybrid strategy is the most effective in\nenhancing the confidence reliability of various models. Meanwhile, we elucidate\nthe impact of different task complexities, model scales, and strategies on\nconfidence performance, and highlight that the confidence of current LLMs in\ncomplex reasoning tasks still has considerable room for improvement.

However, manual kernel design is\nboth costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage\nLLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,\nhowever, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational\noverhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose\nCudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and\noptimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human\nexperts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing\ncorrectness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More\nspecifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that\niteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating\nhardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive\nevaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,\nachieves 97.6\\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\\times$\nspeedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art\nmodels including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,\nCudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,\n3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,\nQwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an\noptimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \\$\n0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that\ncosts 6 H100 hours and \\$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that\nmulti-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,\nand high-performance CUDA kernel optimization.

Experiments on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up\nto 23.8% improvement over baselines and reducing data collection overhead by up\nto 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86STRMAC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7f16\u7801\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8c03\u5ea6\u50f5\u5316\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u53d1\u6325\u3002", "method": "STRMAC\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u522b\u7f16\u7801\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534723.8%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\u51cf\u5c1190.1%\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "STRMAC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u548c\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

Although prior work has explored code changes in\nMLS, it mostly stops at what the changes are, leaving a gap in our knowledge of\nthe relationship between code changes and the MLS quality. To address this gap,\nwe conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,340 open-source Python ML\nprojects, encompassing more than 3.7 million commits and 2.7 trillion lines of\ncode. We introduce PyQu, a novel tool that leverages low level software metrics\nto identify quality-enhancing commits with an average accuracy, precision, and\nrecall of 0.84 and 0.85 of average F1 score. Using PyQu and a thematic\nanalysis, we identified 61 code changes, each demonstrating a direct impact on\nenhancing software quality, and we classified them into 13 categories based on\ncontextual characteristics. 41% of the changes are newly discovered by our\nstudy and have not been identified by state-of-the-art Python changes detection\ntools.

However, for open-ended tasks\nlacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction\nfollowing), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,\nthereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a\nkey question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended\ntasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the\nopen domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose\nthe existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended\ntasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice\nReformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended\ndata into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even\nin the absence of explicit ground truth.

Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine\nrationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy\nand reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level\nscaffolding shapes computation during inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728LLM\u5206\u7c7b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6807\u7b7e\u9644\u52a0\u89e3\u91ca\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u968f\u673atoken\u6784\u6210\u7684\u4f2a\u89e3\u91ca\uff09\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u989d\u5916\u7684token\u9884\u7b97\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8d77\u5230\u4e86\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728LLM\u5206\u7c7b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6807\u7b7e\u9644\u52a0\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591aLLM\u96c6\u6210\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf97B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u7b7e\u52a0\u89e3\u91ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u4ec5\u6807\u7b7e\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u968f\u673atoken\u6784\u6210\u7684\u4f2a\u89e3\u91ca\u66ff\u4ee3\u771f\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u7b7e\u52a0\u89e3\u91ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u572818\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u6807\u7b7e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u4ee4\u4eba\u610f\u5916\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u4f2a\u89e3\u91ca\uff08\u5982\u4e71\u5e8f\u6216\u8bcd\u888b\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u91ca\u589e\u5f3a\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd8\u662f\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6784\u9020\u7684\u968f\u673atoken\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6536\u76ca\u6765\u81ea\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u7684token\u9884\u7b97\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u8d77\u5230\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

Substantial progress has been\nmade towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such\nagents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing\ncoherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,\nan AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended\nobjective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of\nparallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before\nsynthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos\nuses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis\nagent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to\ncoherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively\nexecuting an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.\nKosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,\nensuring its reasoning is traceable.

To address this, offline RL algorithms\ntypically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically\ncategorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show\nthat each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints\ntend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,\nthough least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior\npolicy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint\nthat restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of\nneighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds\nextrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also\napproximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.\nMoreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism\nby adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ\ndata quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood\nconstraint.

In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually\ntightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally\nmaster the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques\nin unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a\nsmoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on\nsimplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full\ndeployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a\nbinary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum\nstrategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes\nthe trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate\nthe effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large\nlanguage model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a\nmulti-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.\nThese results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the\nefficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory\nconstraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy\nenables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial\ninference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for\nresource-constrained deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u6536\u7d27\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9010\u6b65\u638c\u63e1\u90e8\u7f72\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u4f7f\u4efb\u52a1\u53d8\u5f97\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u5230\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u81ea\u5b9a\u8fdb\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ece\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u65bd\u52a0\u5b8c\u6574\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5728LLM\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u538b\u7f29\u8f93\u51fa\u601d\u7ef4\u94fetoken\uff0c\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u3002", "topic": "agentic reinforcement learning"}}

Existing methods, such as offline or\ntransferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly\nmulti-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo\nexperiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,\ncollaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock\ntheir potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that\ntransfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a\nshared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation\nduring multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an\nMoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse\ncooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency\nand performance of backbone algorithms.
