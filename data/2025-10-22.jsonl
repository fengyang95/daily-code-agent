Building on this, we present SIEV, a\nstructured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics.\nUnlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model\nreaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate\ndistinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers\nsignificant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated\nbenchmarks like GSM and MMLU. For instance, GPT-5-chat, a recent model, loses\nover 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM. Our findings\nhighlight that adopting a process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach\nenables a deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM\nreasoning."}

Early research has\nprimarily focused on red teaming, which aims to uncover and evaluate\nvulnerabilities and risks of CodeGen models. However, progress on the blue\nteaming side remains limited, as developing defense requires effective semantic\nunderstanding to differentiate the unsafe from the safe. To fill in this gap,\nwe propose BlueCodeAgent, an end-to-end blue teaming agent enabled by automated\nred teaming. Our framework integrates both sides: red teaming generates diverse\nrisky instances, while the blue teaming agent leverages these to detect\npreviously seen and unseen risk scenarios through constitution and code\nanalysis with agentic integration for multi-level defense. Our evaluation\nacross three representative code-related tasks--bias instruction detection,\nmalicious instruction detection, and vulnerable code detection--shows that\nBlueCodeAgent achieves significant gains over the base models and safety\nprompt-based defenses. In particular, for vulnerable code detection tasks,\nBlueCodeAgent integrates dynamic analysis to effectively reduce false\npositives, a challenging problem as base models tend to be over-conservative,\nmisclassifying safe code as unsafe. Overall, BlueCodeAgent achieves an average\n12.7\\% F1 score improvement across four datasets in three tasks, attributed to\nits ability to summarize actionable constitutions that enhance context-aware\nrisk detection. We demonstrate that the red teaming benefits the blue teaming\nby continuously identifying new vulnerabilities to enhance defense performance."}

Extensive experiments across\ndifferent model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated\nselection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning,\nwhile their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further\nsurpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance\nimprovements while maintaining training efficiency."}

Testing these highly\ninterconnected systems presents a challenge due to the need for access to the\nconnected services. Service virtualization has emerged as a widely used\ntechnique to derive service models from recorded interactions, for service\nresponse generation during system testing. Various methods have been proposed\nto emulate actual service behavior based on these interactions, but most fail\nto account for the service's state, which reduces the accuracy of service\nemulation and the realism of the testing environment, especially when dealing\nwith stateful services. This paper proposes an approach to deriving service\nmodels from service interactions, which enhance the accuracy of response\ngeneration by considering service state. This is achieved by uncovering\ncontextual dependencies among interaction messages and analyzing the\nrelationships between message data values.

While\nprior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may\nnaturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output\nfeatures, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form\n\"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English\", (2) absence rules of the form\n\"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English,\" and (3) counting rules that toggle only\nwhen the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.\nAbsence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of\nexemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or\nincomplete explanations.

To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an\neffective inference-time defense with negligible overhead.

This paper presents KrishokBondhu, a\nvoice-enabled, call-centre-integrated advisory platform built on a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for\nBengali-speaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural\nhandbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications; applies Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) and document-parsing pipelines to digitize and structure the\ncontent; and indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic\nretrieval. Through a simple phone-based interface, farmers can call the system\nto receive real-time, context-aware advice: speech-to-text converts the Bengali\nquery, the RAG module retrieves relevant content, a large language model (Gemma\n3-4B) generates a context-grounded response, and text-to-speech delivers the\nanswer in natural spoken Bengali. In a pilot evaluation, KrishokBondhu produced\nhigh-quality responses for 72.7% of diverse agricultural queries covering crop\nmanagement, disease control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the\nKisanQRS benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs. 3.13) on\na 5-point scale, a 44.7% improvement, with especially large gains in contextual\nrichness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%), while maintaining comparable\nrelevance and technical specificity. Semantic similarity analysis further\nrevealed a strong correlation between retrieved context and answer quality,\nemphasizing the importance of grounding generative responses in curated\ndocumentation. KrishokBondhu demonstrates the feasibility of integrating\ncall-centre accessibility, multilingual voice interaction, and modern RAG\ntechniques to deliver expert-level agricultural guidance to remote Bangladeshi\nfarmers, paving the way toward a fully AI-driven agricultural advisory\necosystem."}

To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that\nquantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines\nfeature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is\nmasked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences\nbetween clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a\nsentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure\nof visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks\n(PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our\nresults show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across\ndatasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond\nthese quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded\ntokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when\ncombined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it\nfurther improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights\nwhy gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together,\nour findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for\ndiagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust\nhallucination detection in multimodal generation."}

Instead of expecting the\nmodels to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to\nprovide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on\ncode-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points\nwhere recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis\nemphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,\nwe leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to\nhighlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those\nlocations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context\nbias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby\nimproving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and\nChinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places\nmore correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error."}

In this work, we propose\nOmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather\nforecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model\nthat encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent\nspace, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of\nfuture latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we\nmask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their\ndistribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion\nhead.

Using longitudinal\ndiagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort,\nwe integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to\nidentify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The\nframework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including\nthe Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective\nCounterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional\nintervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed\nSARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative\nperformance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,\npatient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity\npatterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work\ndemonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization\nproblem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and\ncomputationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex\nbiomedical systems."}
