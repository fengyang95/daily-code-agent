(5 minute read) While the debate between batch and real-time/streaming data pipelines persists, modern tools like Estuary allow seamless toggling between modes, letting teams run real-time for high-stakes needs and batch/micro-batch elsewhere to cut costs. This enables dynamic pipeline adjustments based on business value and use cases, with hybrid or \"right-time\" approaches offering flexibility to balance cost, complexity, and time...", "source": "tldr"}

By treating pipelines like products that come with clear ownership, versioned changes, SLOs, and standardized plumbing, teams can build reliable, observable data foundations that could scale.", "source": "tldr"}
