However, finding test cases that explore\nexecution scenarios beyond the scope of an existing suite can be extremely\nchallenging and labor-intensive, particularly when managing large test suites\nover extended periods.\n  In this paper, we propose E-Test, an approach that reduces the gap between\nthe execution space explored with a test suite and the executions experienced\nafter testing by augmenting the test suite with test cases that explore\nexecution scenarios that emerge in production. E-Test (i) identifies executions\nthat have not yet been tested from large sets of scenarios, such as those\nmonitored during intensive production usage, and (ii) generates new test cases\nthat enhance the test suite. E-Test leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to\npinpoint scenarios that the current test suite does not adequately cover, and\naugments the suite with test cases that execute these scenarios.\n  Our evaluation on a dataset of 1,975 scenarios, collected from highly-starred\nopen-source Java projects already in production and Defects4J, demonstrates\nthat E-Test retrieves not-yet-tested execution scenarios significantly better\nthan state-of-the-art approaches.

However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,\nany-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right\nsampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.\nAt inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked\npositions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute\nwhen left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order\ndecoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs\nto infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish\nbetween reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer\nuncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an\nanswer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the\nMDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new\nsource of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that\nfine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a\nperformance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.\nAdditionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for\nscoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps.

The cases are then handled by a\nlow-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted\nLLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms\nReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,\nand performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all\nmentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM\ntokens."}

To address this challenge, we\npropose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs\ntoken-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.\nInstead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a\nsequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating\nthese tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by\norders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination.

This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant\nto the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.\nExperimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that\nour approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in\nhandling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to\nthe optimal solution."}

We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view\nof meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the\nconditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various\nsparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification\naccuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for\nout-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters\nneeded for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication\ncosts. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD."}

This persistent gap can be attributed to the\nblack-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of\ncurrent evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide\nclear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of\ndifferent models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for\nparticular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a\nsynthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically\nassesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models\nthrough programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding\nfactors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core\nanalytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability\nmapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn\nspecific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,\nwhich quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;\nand (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance\nboundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model\npredictions and mathematical optima.

In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that\nthe forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the\nforecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods\ntypically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply\na reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values\nare coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal\nreconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,\nhowever, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from\nfinite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance\nmatrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a\nrobust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for\nuncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an\nuncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a\nreconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error\nover this uncertainty set.

However, the\nneural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible\n(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning\nand the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network\n(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what\ncomputation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on\na set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To\nconstruct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be\nsystematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where\ncompositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task\nepochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.\nWe first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a\nprobabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online\nlearning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building\nits vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the\nlatent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.\nWe implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed\naccording to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference\nfacilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new\ntasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without\ncatastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy\nand competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its\npotential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional\ngeneralization to unseen tasks."}

We conducted a\nretrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins\nHealth System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208\nadmissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included\nas low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain\ninterpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on\nJHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.\nThe model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over\nthe current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained\nscore optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR\nvariables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the\nperformance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression\n(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk\nlabelling.

Multi-variate time-series analysis has\nemerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in\nsuch environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication\npresents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor\ndata and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,\nthe complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly\nprediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to\nadvance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential\nstep toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault\nprevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:\n(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,\nand (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is\ncompared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a\npredefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the\nforecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by\nutilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second\nlifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture\ninter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting\nperformance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly\nprediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS\nmodel while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower\ncomputational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for\nonline anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments."}

To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought\ncommunication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to\ntelepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize\nthe process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are\ngenerated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts.

Previous approaches primarily focus on\nthe cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal\ndistributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct\nmeaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)\nmixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the\nmost prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates\nincreasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we\npropose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically\nachieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation\nlearning and cross-modal alignment.

Our analysis shows\nthat Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong\nrule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by\nconsistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the\ntraining data.
