On large highway and bridge projects, this delay limits early intervention and increases the risk of rework, schedule impacts, and fragmented documentation. This study presents a construction-phase digital twin framework designed to support element-level QA and readiness-based decision making during active construction. The framework links inspection records, material production and placement data, early-age sensing, and predictive strength models to individual construction elements. By integrating these data streams, the system represents the evolving quality state of each element and supports structured release or hold decisions before standard-age test results are available. The approach does not replace established inspection and testing procedures. Instead, it supplements existing workflows by improving traceability and enabling earlier, data-informed quality assessments. Practical considerations related to data integration, contractual constraints, and implementation challenges are also discussed. The proposed framework provides a structured pathway for transitioning construction QA from delayed, document-driven review toward proactive, element-level decision support during construction."}

Guided by these principles, we propose a training environment, Hybrid-Gym, consisting of a set of scalable synthetic tasks, such as function localization and dependency search. Experiments show that agents trained on our synthetic tasks effectively generalize to diverse real-world tasks that are not present in training, improving a base model by 25.4% absolute gain on SWE-Bench Verified, 7.9% on SWT-Bench Verified, and 5.1% on Commit-0 Lite.

In this early results paper, we study Obsidian, a knowledge--centric platform whose community is focused on writing, organization, and creativity--has built a substantial plugin ecosystem despite not being developer--centric. We investigate what kinds of plugins exist within this hybrid ecosystem and establish a foundation for understanding how they are maintained. Using repository mining and LLM-based topic modeling on a representative sample of 396 plugins, we identify six topics related to knowledge management and tooling, which is (i) dynamic editing and organization, (ii) interface and layouts, (iii) creative writing and productivity, (iv) knowledge sync solutions, (v) linking and script tools, and (vi) workflow enhancements tools. Furthermore, analysis of the Pull Requests from these plugins show that much software evolution has been performed on these ecosystem. These findings suggest that even in mixed communities, plugin ecosystems can develop recognizable engineering structures, motivating future work that highlight three different research directions with six research questions related to the health and sustainability of these non-developer ecosystems."}

In this work, we investigate whether reference-guided LLM-evaluators can bridge this gap by serving as soft \"verifiers\". First, we design evaluation protocols that enhance LLM-based evaluators for LLM alignment using reference outputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that a reference-guided approach substantially improves the accuracy of less capable LLM-judges using references from frontier models; stronger LLM-judges can also be enhanced by high-quality (i.e., human-written) references. Building on these improved judges, we demonstrate the utility of high-quality references in alignment tuning, where LLMs guided with references are used as judges to self-improve. We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model. Specifically, our method achieves 73.1% and 58.7% on AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard with Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and 70.0% and 74.1% with Qwen2.5-7B, corresponding to average absolute gains of +20.2 / +17.1 points over SFT distillation and +5.3 / +3.6 points over reference-free self-improvement on AlpacaEval / Arena-Hard.

Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways). Results reveal that hard braking and acceleration frequencies emerge as the most influential features. Such improvements are more pronounced under congested, low-speed traffic conditions."}

These limitations hinder transparency and reproducibility, amplified by the increasing adoption of AI- based methods. The AIdentifyAGE ontology is domain-specific and provides a standardized, semantically coherent framework, encompassing both manual and AI-assisted forensic dental age assessment workflows, and enabling traceable linkage between observations, methods, reference data, and reported outcomes. It models the complete medico-legal workflow, integrating judicial context, individual-level information, forensic examination data, dental developmental assessment methods, radiographic imaging, statistical reference studies, and AI-based estimation methods.

However, these agents are prone to a wide range of misbehaviors, such as deviating from the user's instructions, getting stuck in repetitive loops, or failing to use tools correctly. These failures disrupt the development workflow and often require resource-intensive manual intervention. In this paper, we present a system for automatically recovering from agentic misbehaviors at scale. We first introduce a taxonomy of misbehaviors grounded in an analysis of production traffic, identifying three primary categories: Specification Drift, Reasoning Problems, and Tool Call Failures, which we find occur in about 30% of all agent trajectories.\n  To address these issues, we developed a lightweight, asynchronous self-intervention system named Wink. Wink observes agent trajectories and provides targeted course-correction guidance to nudge the agent back to a productive path. We evaluated our system on over 10,000 real world agent trajectories and found that it successfully resolves 90% of the misbehaviors that require a single intervention. Furthermore, a live A/B test in our production environment demonstrated that our system leads to a statistically significant reduction in Tool Call Failures, Tokens per Session and Engineer Interventions per Session. We present our experience designing and deploying this system, offering insights into the challenges of building resilient agentic systems at scale."}

However, these models demonstrate a training data bias towards a small number of popular languages or rely on transfer learning from high- to under-resourced languages; this may lead to a misrepresentation of social, cultural, and historical aspects. To address this challenge, monolingual LLMs have been developed for under-resourced languages; however, their effectiveness remains less studied when compared to multilingual counterparts on language-specific tasks. In this study, we address this research gap in Greek QA by contributing: (i) DemosQA, a novel dataset, which is constructed using social media user questions and community-reviewed answers to better capture the Greek social and cultural zeitgeist; (ii) a memory-efficient LLM evaluation framework adaptable to diverse QA datasets and languages; and (iii) an extensive evaluation of 11 monolingual and multilingual LLMs on 6 human-curated Greek QA datasets using 3 different prompting strategies.

The model then determines the likelihood that the next day would be a spike day and reports a confidence score. Using historical data from the Texas electricity market, we demonstrate that this few-shot approach achieves performance comparable to supervised machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and outperforms the latter two when limited historical data are available.

In practice, however, they exhibit a sharp degradation of sample quality in the few-step regime, failing to realize this promise. Here we show that language models leveraging flow-based continuous denoising can outperform discrete diffusion in both quality and speed. By revisiting the fundamentals of flows over discrete modalities, we build a flow-based language model (FLM) that performs Euclidean denoising over one-hot token encodings. We show that the model can be trained by predicting the clean data via a cross entropy objective, where we introduce a simple time reparameterization that greatly improves training stability and generation quality. By distilling FLM into its associated flow map, we obtain a distilled flow map language model (FMLM) capable of few-step generation. On the LM1B and OWT language datasets, FLM attains generation quality matching state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models. With FMLM, our approach outperforms recent few-step language models across the board, with one-step generation exceeding their 8-step quality. Our work calls into question the widely held hypothesis that discrete diffusion processes are necessary for generative modeling over discrete modalities, and paves the way toward accelerated flow-based language modeling at scale.

However, existing approaches mainly rely on post-crash features (e.g., crash type and severity) that are rarely available in real time, limiting their practical applicability. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid secondary crash likelihood prediction framework that does not depend on post-crash features. A dynamic spatiotemporal window is designed to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and their upstream segments. The framework includes three models: a primary crash model to estimate the likelihood of secondary crash occurrence, and two secondary crash models to evaluate traffic conditions at crash and upstream segments under different comparative scenarios. An ensemble learning strategy integrating six machine learning algorithms is developed to enhance predictive performance, and a voting-based mechanism combines the outputs of the three models. Experiments on Florida freeways demonstrate that the proposed hybrid framework correctly identifies 91% of secondary crashes with a low false alarm rate of 0.20. The Area Under the ROC Curve improves from 0.654, 0.744, and 0.902 for the individual models to 0.952 for the hybrid model, outperforming previous studies."}

Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure. Our results identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation."}

A single multilingual instruction-tuned language model handles question generation, question answering, candidate answer extraction, and question importance weighting. This unified design reduces system complexity and computational cost. To capture semantic consistency beyond surface-level overlap, we use BERTScore-Recall for answer comparison. We validate BanglaSummEval on 300 human-written summaries from educational and medical domains, demonstrating strong correlation with expert human judgments (Pearson's $r = 0.694$, Spearman's $ρ= 0.763$). By providing interpretable, step-wise diagnostics alongside reliable evaluation scores, BanglaSummEval offers a practical and transparent solution for factual consistency evaluation in low-resource language settings."}

However, many benchmarks quickly become saturated, meaning that they can no longer differentiate between the best-performing models, diminishing their long-term value. In this study, we analyze benchmark saturation across 60 Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks selected from technical reports by major model developers. To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates. Our analysis reveals that nearly half of the benchmarks exhibit saturation, with rates increasing as benchmarks age. Notably, hiding test data (i.e., public vs. private) shows no protective effect, while expert-curated benchmarks resist saturation better than crowdsourced ones.

However, Meenzerisch is on the verge of dying out-a fate it shares with many other German dialects. Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to help with the preservation and revival efforts of languages and dialects. However, so far no NLP research has looked at Meenzerisch. This work presents the first research in the field of NLP that is explicitly focused on the dialect of Mainz. We introduce a digital dictionary-an NLP-ready dataset derived from an existing resource (Schramm, 1966)-to support researchers in modeling and benchmarking the language. It contains 2,351 words in the dialect paired with their meanings described in Standard German. We then use this dataset to answer the following research questions: (1) Can state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) generate definitions for dialect words? (2) Can LLMs generate words in Meenzerisch, given their definitions? Our experiments show that LLMs can do neither: the best model for definitions reaches only 6.27% accuracy and the best word generation model's accuracy is 1.51%. We then conduct two additional experiments in order to see if accuracy is improved by few-shot learning and by extracting rules from the training set, which are then passed to the LLM. While those approaches are able to improve the results, accuracy remains below 10%. This highlights that additional resources and an intensification of research efforts focused on German dialects are desperately needed."}

However, achieving sample-efficient test-time self-consistency under a limited budget remains an open challenge. We introduce PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-TimeSelf-Consistency), which initiates a principled study of trajectory allocation through an optimization framework. Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation. On GPQA, PETS achieves perfect self-consistency in both settings while reducing the sampling budget by up to 75% (offline) and 55% (online) relative to uniform allocation.

Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work."}

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) has been an essential part of the web since the beginning, as it allows defining webpages in a tree-like manner, including semantics and content. Although the web was never meant to be an application platform, it evolved as such, especially since the early 2000s, as web application frameworks became available. While the emergence of frameworks made it easier than ever to develop complex applications, it also put HTML on the back burner. As web standards caught up, especially with milestones such as HTML5, the gap between the web platform and frameworks was reduced. HTML First development emphasizes this shift and puts focus on literally using HTML first when possible, while encouraging minimalism familiar from the early days of the web. It seems HTML-oriented web development can provide clear benefits to developers, especially when it is combined with comple- mentary approaches, such as embracing hypermedia and moving a large part of application logic to the server side. In the context of the htmx project, it was observed that moving towards HTML can reduce the size of a codebase greatly while leading to maintenance and development benefits due to the increased conceptual simplicity. Holotype-based comparisons for content-oriented websites show performance benefits, and the same observation was confirmed by a small case study where the Yle website was converted to follow HTML First principles. In short, the HTML First approach seems to have clear advantages for web developers, while there are open questions related to the magnitude of the benefits and the alignment with the recent trend of AI-driven web development."}

Classical factorization methods, such as Trial Division and Pollard's Rho, are inefficient for large keys, while Shor's quantum algorithm can break RSA efficiently in polynomial time. This research studies RSA's vulnerabilities under both classical and quantum attacks and designs a hybrid security framework to ensure data protection in the post-quantum era. The conceptual framework combines AES encryption for classical security, BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure key exchange with eavesdropping detection, quantum state comparison for lightweight authentication, and a bio-inspired immune system for adaptive threat detection. RSA is vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, BB84 achieves full key agreement in ideal conditions, and it detects eavesdropping with high accuracy. The conceptual model includes both classical and quantum security methods, providing a scalable and adaptive solution for Post-Quantum encryption data protection. This work primarily proposes a conceptual framework. Detailed implementation, security proofs, and extensive experimental validation are considered future work."}

We present a geometric analysis of optimization dynamics in transformers trained on modular arithmetic. PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes. Causal intervention experiments establish that orthogonal gradient flow is necessary but not sufficient for grokking: suppressing it prevents generalization with a monotonic dose-response across four operations, while artificially boosting curvature defects has no effect."}

Disjunction composition allows for modeling and testing the integrated behavior while ensuring that the testing power of the original set of scenarios is preserved. This is proved using a symbolic semantics for BDD transition systems, with the property that the symbolic equivalence of two BDD transition systems guarantees that they fail the same test cases. Also, we demonstrate the potential of disjunction composition by applying the composition in an industrial case study."}

With major corporations and academic institutions investing in quantum hardware and software, there has been a rise in the development of quantum-enabled systems, particularly within open-source communities.

These anti-patterns, prevalent in open-source environments, have the potential to negatively impact both product quality and community health by introducing technical debt and amplifying architectural and code smells. Despite the importance of these socio-technical factors, there remains a scarcity of research investigating their influence within quantum open-source communities.

We categorize Potentially Euphemistic Terms (PETs) in Turkish and English into Overlapping (OPETs) and Non-Overlapping (NOPETs) subsets based on their functional, pragmatic, and semantic alignment. Our findings reveal a transfer asymmetry: semantic overlap is insufficient to guarantee positive transfer, particularly in low-resource Turkish-to-English direction, where performance can degrade even for overlapping euphemisms, and in some cases, improve under NOPET-based training. Differences in label distribution help explain these counterintuitive results. Category-level analysis suggests that transfer may be influenced by domain-specific alignment, though evidence is limited by sparsity."}

We introduce the Computer-Using World Model (CUWM), a world model for desktop software that predicts the next UI state given the current state and a candidate action. CUWM adopts a two-stage factorization of UI dynamics: it first predicts a textual description of agent-relevant state changes, and then realizes these changes visually to synthesize the next screenshot.

The resulting framework supports scalable, auditable digital-humanities analysis while preserving interpretive caution by propagating uncertainty from verse-level evidence to poet-level inference."}

These alternatives require accurate propagation of satellite position and velocity with a realistic quantification of uncertainty. It is commonly assumed that the propagated uncertainty distribution is Gaussian; however, the validity of this assumption can be quickly compromised by the mismodeling of atmospheric drag. We develop a machine learning approach that corrects error growth in the argument of latitude for a diverse set of LEO satellites. The improved orbit propagation accuracy extends the applicability of the Gaussian assumption and modeling of the errors with a corrected mean and covariance. We compare the performance of a time-conditioned neural network and a Gaussian Process on datasets computed with an open source orbit propagator and publicly available Vector Covariance Message (VCM) ephemerides. The learned models predict the argument of latitude error as a Gaussian distribution given parameters from a single VCM epoch and reverse propagation errors. We show that this one-dimensional model captures the effect of mismodeled drag, which can be mapped to the Cartesian state space. The correction method only updates information along the dimensions of dominant error growth, while maintaining the physics-based propagation of VCM covariance in the remaining dimensions. We therefore extend the utility of VCM ephemerides to longer time horizons without modifying the functionality of the existing propagator."}

This paper proposes a unified framework, where each score is explicitly defined with respect to a given order. This order-oriented perspective enables more flexible and coherent scoring mechanisms. We examine several classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements, that is, nonempty subsets in [0,1], and show that, contrary to prior claims, they do not induce lattice structures. In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the Gärdenfors condition.\n  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements. They aim to compare hesitant fuzzy elements relative to control sets incorporating minimum acceptability thresholds. Two concrete examples of dominance functions for finite sets are provided: the discrete dominance function and the relative dominance function. We show that these can be employed to construct fuzzy preference relations on typical hesitant fuzzy sets and support group decision-making."}

Current approaches typically encode ethics as fixed, rule-based constraints or as a single chosen ethical theory embedded at design time. This overlooks a fundamental property of human-system interaction settings: ethical preferences vary across individuals and groups, evolve with context, and may conflict, while still needing to remain within a legally and regulatorily defined hard-ethics envelope (e.g., safety and compliance constraints). This paper advocates a shift from static ethical rules to runtime ethical reasoning for self-adaptive systems, where ethical preferences are treated as runtime requirements that must be elicited, represented, and continuously revised as stakeholders and situations change. We argue that satisfying such requirements demands explicit ethics-based negotiation to manage ethical trade-offs among multiple humans who interact with, are represented by, or are affected by a system. We identify key challenges, ethical uncertainty, conflicts among ethical values (including human, societal, and environmental drivers), and multi-dimensional/multi-party/multi-driver negotiation, and outline research directions and questions toward ethically self-adaptive systems."}

In this paper, we describe how distribution shifts in language models can be separated into observable and unobservable components, and we discuss how established approaches for dealing with distribution shift address only the former. Importantly, we identify that the resulting omitted variable bias from unobserved variables can compromise both evaluation and optimization in language models. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework that maps the strength of the omitted variables to bounds on the worst-case generalization performance of language models under distribution shift. In empirical experiments, we show that using these bounds directly in language model evaluation and optimization provides more principled measures of out-of-distribution performance, improves true out-of-distribution performance relative to standard distribution shift adjustment methods, and further enables inference about the strength of the omitted variables when target distribution labels are available."}

Rather than focusing on error prevention, this work focuses on error recovery, which necessitates the accurate diagnosis of erroneous dialogue contexts and execution of proper recovery plans. Under realistic constraints precluding model fine-tuning or prompt modification due to significant cost and time requirements, we explore whether agents can recover from contextually flawed interactions and how their behavior can be adapted without altering model parameters and prompts. To this end, we propose Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time intervention method that plants an initial reasoning into the agent's decision-making process. Specifically, an external inception module identifies predefined errors within the dialogue context and generates recovery plans, which are subsequently integrated into the agent's internal reasoning process to guide corrective actions, without modifying its parameters or system prompts. We evaluate ReIn by systematically simulating conversational failure scenarios that directly hinder successful completion of user goals: user's ambiguous and unsupported requests. Across diverse combinations of agent models and inception modules, ReIn substantially improves task success and generalizes to unseen error types. Moreover, it consistently outperforms explicit prompt-modification approaches, underscoring its utility as an efficient, on-the-fly method. In-depth analysis of its operational mechanism, particularly in relation to instruction hierarchy, indicates that jointly defining recovery tools with ReIn can serve as a safe and effective strategy for improving the resilience of conversational agents without modifying the backbone models or system prompts."}

In this work, we introduce double counterfactual consistency (DCC), a lightweight inference-time method for measuring and guiding the ability of LLMs to reason causally. Without requiring labeled counterfactual data, DCC verifies a model's ability to execute two important elements of causal reasoning: causal intervention and counterfactual prediction. Using DCC, we evaluate the causal reasoning abilities of various leading LLMs across a range of reasoning tasks and interventions. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DCC as a training-free test-time rejection sampling criterion and show that it can directly improve performance on reasoning tasks across multiple model families."}

However, theoretical work in the field suggests that first-personal interaction is a crucial part of ToM and that such predictive, spectatorial tasks may fail to evaluate it. We address this gap with a novel ToM task that requires an agent to persuade a target to choose one of three policy proposals by strategically revealing information. Success depends on a persuader's sensitivity to a given target's knowledge states (what the target knows about the policies) and motivational states (how much the target values different outcomes). We varied whether these states were Revealed to persuaders or Hidden, in which case persuaders had to inquire about or infer them. In Experiment 1, participants persuaded a bot programmed to make only rational inferences. LLMs excelled in the Revealed condition but performed below chance in the Hidden condition, suggesting difficulty with the multi-step planning required to elicit and use mental state information. Humans performed moderately well in both conditions, indicating an ability to engage such planning. In Experiment 2, where a human target role-played the bot, and in Experiment 3, where we measured whether human targets' real beliefs changed, LLMs outperformed human persuaders across all conditions. These results suggest that effective persuasion can occur without explicit ToM reasoning (e.g., through rhetorical strategies) and that LLMs excel at this form of persuasion. Overall, our results caution against attributing human-like ToM to LLMs while highlighting LLMs' potential to influence people's beliefs and behavior."}

Our method relies on insights about grader failure in solver-grader pipelines, which we call the Cognitive Well (iterative refinement converging to a wrong solution that the solver as well as the pipeline's internal grader consider to be basically correct). Our pipeline addresses these failure modes through conjecture extraction, wherein candidate lemmas are isolated from generated solutions and independently verified alongside their negations in a fresh environment (context detachment). On IMO-ProofBench Advanced (PB-Adv), our pipeline achieves 67.1 percent performance using Gemini 3.0 Pro with an average cost per question of approximately 31 USD. At the time of evaluation, this represented the state-of-the-art on PB-Adv among both public and unreleased models, and more than doubles the success rate of the next best publicly accessible pipeline, all at a fraction of the cost."}

Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation."}

The online keyword-driven data collection results in a significant amount of irrelevant content. We explore four approaches to filter relevant content: (1) translating English annotated data into target languages for building language-specific models for each target language, (2) translating unlabelled data appearing from all languages into English for creating a single model based on English annotations, (3) applying English fine-tuned multilingual transformers directly to each target language data, and (4) a hybrid strategy that combines translated annotations with multilingual training.

In this work, we present Tail-aware Flow Fine-Tuning (TFFT), a principled and efficient distributional fine-tuning algorithm based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We address two distinct tail-shaping goals: right-CVaR for seeking novel samples in the high-reward tail and left-CVaR for controlling worst-case samples in the low-reward tail. Unlike prior approaches that rely on non-linear optimization, we leverage the variational dual formulation of CVaR to decompose it into a decoupled two-stage procedure: a lightweight one-dimensional threshold optimization step, and a single entropy-regularized fine-tuning process via a specific pseudo-reward. This decomposition achieves CVaR fine-tuning efficiently with computational cost comparable to standard expected fine-tuning methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TFFT across illustrative experiments, high-dimensional text-to-image generation, and molecular design."}

Building on these insights, TopoFlow leverages a vision transformer architecture with two novel mechanisms: topography-aware attention, which explicitly models terrain-induced flow patterns, and wind-guided patch reordering, which aligns spatial representations with prevailing wind directions. Trained on six years of high-resolution reanalysis data assimilating observations from over 1,400 surface monitoring stations across China, TopoFlow achieves a PM2.5 RMSE of 9.71 ug/m3, representing a 71-80% improvement over operational forecasting systems and a 13% improvement over state-of-the-art AI baselines. Forecast errors remain well below China's 24-hour air quality threshold of 75 ug/m3 (GB 3095-2012), enabling reliable discrimination between clean and polluted conditions. These performance gains are consistent across all four major pollutants and forecast lead times from 12 to 96 hours, demonstrating that principled integration of physical knowledge into neural networks can fundamentally advance air quality prediction."}

We evaluate a broad set of open- and closed-source models, including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5, which achieve the strongest results on the easy level of the task and demonstrate superhuman performance. Despite this, performance drops sharply on hard difficulty: the best-performing model, Gemini-3, succeeds in only 23\\% of hard games, highlighting substantial remaining challenges for frontier models. Our analysis shows that world knowledge is a necessary ingredient for success, but only up to a point, beyond this threshold, planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities become the dominant factors. Trajectory-level analysis further reveals that even the strongest models struggle to replan after failure, frequently entering loops rather than recovering.

However, these models still exhibit low accuracy in core banking computations-including total payout estimation, comparison of products with varying interest rates, and interest calculation under early repayment conditions. Such tasks require multi-step numerical reasoning and contextual understanding of banking products, yet existing LLMs often make systematic errors-misinterpreting product types, applying conditions incorrectly, or failing basic calculations involving exponents and geometric progressions. However, such errors have rarely been captured by existing benchmarks. Mathematical datasets focus on fundamental math problems, whereas financial benchmarks primarily target financial documents, leaving everyday banking scenarios underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose BankMathBench, a domain-specific dataset that reflects realistic banking tasks. BankMathBench is organized in three levels of difficulty-basic, intermediate, and advanced-corresponding to single-product reasoning, multi-product comparison, and multi-condition scenarios, respectively. When trained on BankMathBench, open-source LLMs exhibited notable improvements in both formula generation and numerical reasoning accuracy, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing domain-specific reasoning. With tool-augmented fine-tuning, the models achieved average accuracy increases of 57.6%p (basic), 75.1%p (intermediate), and 62.9%p (advanced), representing significant gains over zero-shot baselines.

We focus on three types of guarantees: (1) *input domain robustness*, ensuring the circuit agrees with the model across a continuous input region; (2) *robust patching*, certifying circuit alignment under continuous patching perturbations; and (3) *minimality*, formalizing and capturing a wide array of various notions of succinctness. Interestingly, we uncover a diverse set of novel theoretical connections among these three families of guarantees, with critical implications for the convergence of our algorithms. Finally, we conduct experiments with state-of-the-art verifiers on various vision models, showing that our algorithms yield circuits with substantially stronger robustness guarantees than standard circuit discovery methods, establishing a principled foundation for provable circuit discovery."}

Through experiments on Gemma3-4B, we show that misalignment scales monotonically with LoRA rank, and that multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment ($70.71 \\pm 1.22$ at $r=128$) than text-only evaluation ($41.19 \\pm 2.51$), suggesting that unimodal safety benchmarks may underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models. Critically, even 10\\% harmful data in the training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation. Geometric analysis reveals that harmful behaviors occupy a remarkably low-dimensional subspace, with the majority of misalignment information captured in 10 principal components. To mitigate misalignment, we evaluate two strategies: benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering. While both approaches substantially reduce misalignment, neither completely removes the learned harmful behaviors.

Traditional benchmarks measure transient task accuracy but fail to capture stable, latent response policies -- the ``prevailing mindsets'' embedded during training and alignment that outlive individual model versions.\n  This paper introduces a novel auditing framework that utilizes psychometric measurement theory -- specifically latent trait estimation under ordinal uncertainty -- to quantify these tendencies without relying on ground-truth labels. Utilizing forced-choice ordinal vignettes masked by semantically orthogonal decoys and governed by cryptographic permutation-invariance, the research audits nine leading models across dimensions including Optimization Bias, Sycophancy, and Status-Quo Legitimization.\n  Using Mixed Linear Models (MixedLM) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) analysis, the research identifies that while item-level framing drives high variance, a persistent ``lab signal'' accounts for significant behavioral clustering. These findings demonstrate that in ``locked-in'' provider ecosystems, latent biases are not merely static errors but compounding variables that risk creating recursive ideological echo chambers in multi-layered AI architectures."}

Using a sample of 77,334 anonymised patient question--doctor response pairs, we model feedback as a binary outcome, treating thumbs-up responses as positive and grouping negative or absent feedback into the other class. We extract interpretable, predominantly language-agnostic features (e.g., length, structural characteristics, readability proxies), along with Romanian LIWC psycholinguistic features and politeness/hedging markers where available. We train a classifier with a time-based split and perform SHAP-based analyses, which indicate that patient and clinician history features dominate prediction, functioning as strong priors, while characteristics of the response text provide a smaller but, crucially, actionable signal.

We study VAM in chess and evaluate it under two training regimes: an engine-play regime that generates states via play against an engine opponent and a fixed-dataset regime that trains from a fixed dataset of positions with verifier scores.

Yet these instruments presume honest responding; in evaluative contexts, LLMs can instead gravitate toward socially preferred answers-a form of socially desirable responding (SDR)-biasing questionnaire-derived scores and downstream conclusions. We propose a psychometric framework to quantify and mitigate SDR in questionnaire-based evaluation of LLMs. To quantify SDR, the same inventory is administered under HONEST versus FAKE-GOOD instructions, and SDR is computed as a direction-corrected standardized effect size from item response theory (IRT)-estimated latent scores. This enables comparisons across constructs and response formats, as well as against human instructed-faking benchmarks. For mitigation, we construct a graded forced-choice (GFC) Big Five inventory by selecting 30 cross-domain pairs from an item pool via constrained optimization to match desirability. Across nine instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on synthetic personas with known target profiles, Likert-style questionnaires show consistently large SDR, whereas desirability-matched GFC substantially attenuates SDR while largely preserving the recovery of the intended persona profiles. These results highlight a model-dependent SDR-recovery trade-off and motivate SDR-aware reporting practices for questionnaire-based benchmarking and auditing of LLMs."}

We introduce Progressive Thought Encoding, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that enables LRMs to reason effectively under fixed-size caches. By progressively encoding intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vector representations, our approach eliminates the need to backpropagate through full-cache rollouts, thereby reducing memory usage, while maintaining constant memory during inference.

Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems."}

A standard next-token prediction training strategy, while widely adopted in practice, may lead to overlooked artifacts such as representation collapse. Previous works have shown that this problem is especially pronounced in the representation of the deeper Transformer layers, where it often fails to efficiently utilize the geometric space. Representation collapse is even more evident in end-to-end training of continuous-output neural machine translation, where the trivial solution would be to set all vectors to the same value. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of representation collapse at different levels of discrete and continuous NMT transformers throughout training. We incorporate an existing regularization method based on angular dispersion and demonstrate empirically that it not only mitigates collapse but also improves translation quality. Furthermore, we show that quantized models exhibit similar collapse behavior and that the benefits of regularization are preserved even after quantization."}

An Exact Analysis for the Data-driven Newsvendor", "comment": null, "summary": "We study the offline data-driven newsvendor problem with censored demand data. In contrast to prior works where demand is fully observed, we consider the setting where demand is censored at the inventory level and only sales are observed; sales match demand when there is sufficient inventory, and equal the available inventory otherwise. We provide a general procedure to compute the exact worst-case regret of classical data-driven inventory policies, evaluated over all demand distributions. Our main technical result shows that this infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one, enabling an exact characterization of the performance of policies for any sample size and censoring levels. We leverage this reduction to derive sharp insights on the achievable performance of standard inventory policies under demand censoring. In particular, our analysis of the Kaplan-Meier policy shows that while demand censoring fundamentally limits what can be learned from passive sales data, just a small amount of targeted exploration at high inventory levels can substantially improve worst-case guarantees, enabling near-optimal performance even under heavy censoring. In contrast, when the point-of-sale system does not record stockout events and only reports realized sales, a natural and commonly used approach is to treat sales as demand. Our results show that policies based on this sales-as-demand heuristic can suffer severe performance degradation as censored data accumulates, highlighting how the quality of point-of-sale information critically shapes what can, and cannot, be learned offline."}

In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records."}

Yet, their reliability is increasingly questioned due to sensitivity to shallow variations in input prompts. This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs rely more on surface-level lexical patterns than on abstract linguistic competence, underscoring the need for robustness testing as a standard component of LLM evaluation."}

Our work provides a full mechanistic interpretation of the learned model and a theoretical explanation of its training dynamics. While prior work has identified that individual neurons learn single-frequency Fourier features and phase alignment, it does not fully explain how these features combine into a global solution. We bridge this gap by formalizing a diversification condition that emerges during training when overparametrized, consisting of two parts: phase symmetry and frequency diversification. We prove that these properties allow the network to collectively approximate a flawed indicator function on the correct logic for the modular addition task. While individual neurons produce noisy signals, the phase symmetry enables a majority-voting scheme that cancels out noise, allowing the network to robustly identify the correct sum. Furthermore, we explain the emergence of these features under random initialization via a lottery ticket mechanism. Our gradient flow analysis proves that frequencies compete within each neuron, with the \"winner\" determined by its initial spectral magnitude and phase alignment. From a technical standpoint, we provide a rigorous characterization of the layer-wise phase coupling dynamics and formalize the competitive landscape using the ODE comparison lemma. Finally, we use these insights to demystify grokking, characterizing it as a three-stage process involving memorization followed by two generalization phases, driven by the competition between loss minimization and weight decay."}

We formalize and challenge this assumption through latent context-conditioned policies -- models whose outputs depend on unobserved internal variables that are rare under evaluation but prevalent under deployment. We establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. (1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error >= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains >= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires O(1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2)) samples, where gamma = alpha_0 + alpha_1 - 1 measures probe quality, and we provide explicit bias correction under probe error.

In this study, we introduce RPDR, a novel data augmentation framework that selects high-quality easy-to-learn training data, to enhance dense retrievers. Our approach is built around three core components: synthetic data generation, data selection with Round-Trip prediction to identify easy-to-learn instances, and retriever training with these instances. We evaluate RPDR on two long-tail retrieval benchmarks, PopQA and EntityQuestion, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing retrievers like BM25 and Contriver, especially on extremely long-tail categories. We identify the strengths and limitations of RPDR through detailed human analysis and propose a dynamic routing mechanism to dynamically route queries to specialized retrieval modules to further improve retrieval performance."}

With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling."}

In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise.

The availability heuristic, proposed by A. Tversky and D. Kahneman in 1973, suggests that the ease with which relevant instances come to mind, typically operationalised by the mere frequency of exposure, can offer a mental shortcut for problems in which the test-taker does not know the exact answer. Is simply choosing the option that comes most readily to mind a good strategy for answering MCQs? We propose a computational method of assessing the cognitive availability of MCQ options operationalised by concepts' prevalence in large corpora. The key finding, across three large question sets, is that correct answers, independently of the question stem, are significantly more available than incorrect MCQ options. Specifically, using Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, we find that always selecting the most available option leads to scores 13.5% to 32.9% above the random-guess baseline. We further find that LLM-generated MCQ options show similar patterns of availability compared to expert-created options, despite the LLMs' frequentist nature and their training on large collections of textual data. Our findings suggest that availability should be considered in current and future work when computationally modelling student behaviour."}

A novel Ballast Score is proposed to integrate these signals into a unified, cross-modal pruning strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that significant portions of the feature space as often exceeding 70% in sparse or semi-structured data, can be pruned with minimal or even improved classification performance, along with substantial reductions in training time and memory footprint.

The approach accommodates both identity and near-identity relations, e.g., by linking \"the caravan\" - \"asylum seekers\" - \"those contemplating illegal entry\", allowing models to capture lexical diversity and framing variation in media discourse, while maintaining the fine-grained annotation of DEs. We reannotate the NewsWCL50 and a subset of ECB+ using a unified codebook and evaluate the new datasets through lexical diversity metrics and a same-head-lemma baseline.

Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors.

However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the \"non-outlier\" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a \"Sanction Score.\" We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds."}

We propose two complementary tasks: AIDG-I, measuring pragmatic strategy in social deduction, and AIDG-II, measuring constraint satisfaction in a structured \"20 Questions\" setting. Across 439 games with six frontier LLMs, we observe a clear capability asymmetry: models perform substantially better at containment than deduction, with a 350 ELO advantage on defense;(Cohen's d = 5.47). We identify two bottlenecks driving this gap: (1) Information Dynamics, where confirmation strategies are 7.75x more effective than blind deduction (p < 0.00001), and (2) Constraint Adherence, where instruction-following degrades under conversational load, accounting for 41.3% of deductive failures. These findings suggest that while LLMs excel at local defensive coherence, they struggle with the global state tracking required for strategic inquiry."}

However, existing RL methods normally use a \\emph{single} policy network, causing \\emph{simplicity bias} where simple tasks occupy most parameters and dominate gradient updates, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tasks. A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \\emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise.

Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation, which provide new ways to alleviate data scarcity, evaluating data usability remains a challenging task.

A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \\emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^π$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($Π(π)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $Π(π)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $ρ(E^{\\mathrm{s}}+E^{\\mathrm{a}}Π(π)) < 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. Finally, we leverage this theory to analyze a provably-sound localized block-coordinate policy improvement framework with guarantees tied directly to this spectral radius."}

Whether this mechanism extends beyond arithmetic remains open. We study two sequence-learning benchmarks: SCAN compositional generalization and Dyck-1 depth prediction. Across both tasks and a wide range of learning rates, the commutator defect -- a curvature measure derived from non-commuting gradient updates -- rises well before generalization, with lead times following a superlinear power law (alpha approximately 1.18 for SCAN, approximately 1.13 for Dyck), consistent with prior results on modular arithmetic. Weight-space PCA reveals that spectral concentration is not a universal precursor; the commutator defect is. Causal interventions demonstrate a mechanistic role: amplifying non-commutativity accelerates grokking (roughly 32% on SCAN, roughly 50% on Dyck), while suppressing orthogonal gradient flow delays or prevents it. The three task families form a spectrum of causal sensitivity -- modular arithmetic is rigid, Dyck is responsive, SCAN is intermediate -- yet suppression delays or prevents grokking in all cases, establishing necessity as a universal finding. These results identify the commutator defect as a robust, architecture-agnostic, causally implicated early-warning signal for delayed generalization in transformers."}

We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process.

We present a concrete instantiation of this principle: a progressive alignment framework that iteratively identifies and ablates previously learned refusal directions, forcing the model to reconstruct safety along new, independent subspaces. Across four jailbreak attacks, we achieve the strongest overall robustness while mitigating over-refusal and preserving generation quality, with small computational overhead. Our mechanistic analyses confirm that models trained with our method encode multiple, causally independent refusal directions that prompt-based jailbreaks cannot suppress simultaneously, providing empirical support for fail-closed alignment as a principled foundation for robust LLM safety."}

In this work, we firstly present a systematic evaluation of verification strategies across model families, tasks, and sampling regimes, and find that Traversal Verification dominates consistently, with OT-based methods lagging far behind. Our analysis uncovers that this occurs because OT-based methods achieve high multi-token acceptance near the root of the draft tree, while multi-token gains are most impactful deeper in the draft tree, where draft and target distributions diverge. Based on this insight, we propose delayed tree expansion, which drafts a partial single path, delaying the i.i.d. branching point. We show that delayed tree expansion preserves the target distribution and improves on root-node i.i.d rollouts. Further, we develop a dynamic neural selector that estimates the expected block efficiency of optimal-transport-based verification methods from draft and target features, enabling context-dependent expansion decisions.

To address this challenge, we propose an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to label KC-level correctness directly from student-written code. Our method assesses whether each KC is correctly applied and further introduces a temporal context-aware Code-KC mapping mechanism to better align KCs with individual student code.

User requirements are no longer captured by a single metric (e.g., throughput or reliability), but by multi-dimensional objectives such as latency sensitivity, energy preference, computational constraints, and service-level requirements. These objectives may also change over time due to environmental dynamics and user-network interactions. Therefore, accurate understanding of both the communication environment and user intent is critical for autonomous and sustainably evolving 6G communications.\n  Large language models (LLMs), with strong contextual understanding and cross-modal reasoning, provide a promising foundation for intent-aware network agents. Compared with rule-driven or centrally optimized designs, LLM-based agents can integrate heterogeneous information and translate natural-language intents into executable control and configuration decisions.\n  Focusing on a closed-loop pipeline of intent perception, autonomous decision making, and network execution, this paper investigates agentic AI for the 6G physical layer and its realization pathways. We review representative physical-layer tasks and their limitations in supporting intent awareness and autonomy, identify application scenarios where agentic AI is advantageous, and discuss key challenges and enabling technologies in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision making, and sustainable optimization. Finally, we present a case study of an intent-driven link decision agent, termed AgenCom, which adaptively constructs communication links under diverse user preferences and channel conditions."}

Existing defenses often offer limited protection or force a trade-off between safety and utility. We introduce a training framework that adapts regularization in response to safety risk, enabling models to remain aligned throughout fine-tuning. To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost. This work demonstrates a principled mechanism for maintaining safety without sacrificing utility."}

It constructs, what we call, \\textit{coordination contexts}, that enable agents to condition their decisions on global action dependencies. Theoretically, we show that AGPs induce a strictly more expressive joint policy compared to fully independent policies and can realize coordinated joint actions that are provably more optimal than greedy execution even from centralized value-decomposition methods. Empirically, we show that AGP achieves 80-95\\% success on canonical coordination tasks with partial observability and anti-coordination penalties, where other MARL methods reach only 10-25\\%.

The framework enables scalable and comparable assessment of sustainability rating methodologies. We call on the broader AI community to adopt AI-powered approaches to strengthen and advance sustainability rating methodologies that support and enforce urgent sustainability agendas."}

In this work, we introduce the task of modeling human intervention to support collaborative web task execution. We collect CowCorpus, a dataset of 400 real-user web navigation trajectories containing over 4,200 interleaved human and agent actions. We identify four distinct patterns of user interaction with agents -- hands-off supervision, hands-on oversight, collaborative task-solving, and full user takeover. Leveraging these insights, we train language models (LMs) to anticipate when users are likely to intervene based on their interaction styles, yielding a 61.4-63.4% improvement in intervention prediction accuracy over base LMs. Finally, we deploy these intervention-aware models in live web navigation agents and evaluate them in a user study, finding a 26.5% increase in user-rated agent usefulness. Together, our results show structured modeling of human intervention leads to more adaptive, collaborative agents."}

However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels. This hierarchy enables computational pruning while improving attribution accuracy and interpretability. Experiments on image and tabular datasets demonstrate that O-Shap outperforms baseline SHAP variants in attribution precision, semantic coherence, and runtime efficiency, especially when structure matters."}

However, since the objective is defined relative to a group of sampled trajectories, extended deliberation can create more chances to realize relative gains, leading to inefficient reasoning and overthinking, and complicating the trade-off between correctness and rollout efficiency. Controlling this behavior is difficult in practice, considering (i) Length penalties are hard to calibrate because longer rollouts may reflect harder problems that require longer reasoning, penalizing tokens risks truncating useful reasoning along with redundant continuation; and (ii) supervision that directly indicates when to continue or stop is typically unavailable beyond final answer correctness. We propose Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO), which improves rollout efficiency by converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories. Unlike global length penalties that are hard to calibrate, WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals that indicate when additional continuation is beneficial. Thus, WS-GRPO supplies outcome-derived continue/stop guidance, reducing redundant deliberation while maintaining accuracy. We provide theoretical results and empirically show on reasoning benchmarks that WS-GRPO substantially reduces rollout length while remaining competitive with GRPO baselines."}

Capturing these dependencies is critical for identifying students' knowledge gaps and enabling targeted intervention for personalized learning. This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like \"Algorithms\" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., \"part-of\" or \"depends-on\" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., \"recursion\" is taught before \"mergesort\"; \"recursion\" is mentioned in the definition of \"merge sort\") with the generalizability of large language models. Through experiments on real-world, diverse lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, we demonstrate that InstructKG captures rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions."}

Recent advances in AI have the potential to transform such pipelines in a way that domain experts can focus on interpreting and understanding findings, rather than debugging rigid pipelines or manually annotating data. As part of an active collaboration between data science/AI researchers and behavioral neuroscientists, we showcase an example AI-enhanced pipeline, specifically designed to transform and accelerate the way that the domain experts in the team are able to gain insights out of experimental data. The application at hand is in the domain of behavioral neuroscience, studying fear generalization in mice, an important problem whose progress can advance our understanding of clinically significant and often debilitating conditions such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). We identify the emerging paradigm of \"In-Context Learning\" (ICL) as a suitable interface for domain experts to automate parts of their pipeline without the need for or familiarity with AI model training and fine-tuning, and showcase its remarkable efficacy in data preparation and pattern interpretation. Also, we introduce novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition model, which allows for more seamless pattern discovery from the heterogeneous data in our application. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed pipeline experimentally, showcasing its superior performance compared to what is standard practice in the domain, as well as against reasonable ML baselines that do not fall under the ICL paradigm, to ensure that we are not compromising performance in our quest for a seamless and easy-to-use interface for domain experts.

Unlike previous technological transformations, where engineering understanding preceded or accompanied deployment, generative AI operates through mechanisms whose epistemic character remains obscure, and without such understanding, its responsible integration into science, education, and institutional life cannot proceed on a principled basis. This paper argues that the missing account must begin with a paradigmatic break that has not yet received adequate philosophical attention. In the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, information enters the machine as encoded binary vectors, and semantics remains external to the process. Neural network architectures rupture this regime: symbolic input is instantly projected into a high-dimensional space where coordinates correspond to semantic parameters, transforming binary code into a position in a geometric space of meanings. It is this space that constitutes the active epistemic condition shaping generative production. Drawing on four structural properties of high-dimensional geometry concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity the paper develops an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces. Building on Peirce semiotics and Papert constructionism, it reconceptualizes generative models as navigators of learned manifolds and proposes navigational knowledge as a third mode of knowledge production, distinct from both symbolic reasoning and statistical recombination."}

In this paper, we extend this paradigm to differential argument marking (DAM), a semantic licensing system in which morphological marking depends on semantic prominence. Using a controlled synthetic learning method, we train GPT-2 models on 18 corpora implementing distinct DAM systems and evaluate their generalization using minimal pairs. Our results reveal a dissociation between two typological dimensions of DAM. Models reliably exhibit human-like preferences for natural markedness direction, favoring systems in which overt marking targets semantically atypical arguments. In contrast, models do not reproduce the strong object preference in human languages, in which overt marking in DAM more often targets objects rather than subjects. These findings suggest that different typological tendencies may arise from distinct underlying sources."}

However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments."}

With reasonable table sizing, it often eliminates these collisions entirely while maintaining production-scale efficiency. MPZCH utilizes auxiliary tensors and high-performance CUDA kernels to implement configurable probing and active eviction policies.

Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail.

While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines. By providing a more robust and biologically grounded representation, JEPA-DNA offers a scalable path toward foundation models that understand not only the genomic alphabet, but also the underlying functional logic of the sequence."}

NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients. Experiments on pretraining GPT-2 models demonstrate improved performance of both NAMO and NAMO-D compared to the AdamW and Muon baselines, with NAMO-D achieving further gains over NAMO via an additional clamping hyperparameter that balances the competing goals of maintaining a well-conditioned update direction and leveraging fine-grained noise adaptation."}

However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts. This coordinated design enables selective disruption of target-specific representations while preserving shared semantic structures. As a result, MeGU enables controlled and selective forgetting, effectively mitigating both under-unlearning and over-unlearning."}

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support."}

By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data."}

Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\\times$."}

In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning."}

Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample. These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure. In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space. TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Notably, it yields 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset. In addition, TIFO reduces computational costs by 60% -70% compared to baseline methods, demonstrating strong scalability across diverse forecasting models."}

While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches."}

In this paper, we propose VP-VAE (Vector Perturbation VAE), a novel paradigm that decouples representation learning from discretization by eliminating the need for an explicit codebook during training. Our key insight is that, from the neural network's viewpoint, performing quantization primarily manifests as injecting a structured perturbation in latent space. Accordingly, VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with distribution-consistent and scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis--Hastings sampling. This design enables stable training without a codebook while making the model robust to inference-time quantization error. Moreover, under the assumption of approximately uniform latent variables, we derive FSP (Finite Scalar Perturbation), a lightweight variant of VP-VAE that provides a unified theoretical explanation and a practical improvement for FSQ-style fixed quantizers. Extensive experiments on image and audio benchmarks demonstrate that VP-VAE and FSP improve reconstruction fidelity and achieve substantially more balanced token usage, while avoiding the instability inherent to coupled codebook training."}

This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models. Finally, we bring some clarifications on multimodal integration by testing our model on all subsets of modalities, finding that integration is not always beneficial to the task."}

In this work, we show that multi-expert L2D is fundamentally more challenging than the single-expert case. With multiple experts, the classifier's underfitting becomes inherent, which seriously degrades prediction performance, whereas in the single-expert setting it arises only under specific conditions. We theoretically reveal that this stems from an intrinsic expert identifiability issue: learning which expert to trust from a diverse pool, a problem absent in the single-expert case and renders existing underfitting remedies failed. To tackle this issue, we propose PiCCE (Pick the Confident and Correct Expert), a surrogate-based method that adaptively identifies a reliable expert based on empirical evidence. PiCCE effectively reduces multi-expert L2D to a single-expert-like learning problem, thereby resolving multi expert underfitting. We further prove its statistical consistency and ability to recover class probabilities and expert accuracies. Extensive experiments across diverse settings, including real-world expert scenarios, validate our theoretical results and demonstrate improved performance."}

However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements."}

Although unified multimodal models (UMMs) have bridged this gap in vision, their potential for time series remains untapped. We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks. With a calibrated Chain-of-Thought, TimeOmni-VL is the first to leverage time series understanding as an explicit control signal for high-fidelity generation.

However, ZO optimization has a fundamental tension between accuracy and query efficiency. In this work, we show that ZO optimization can be substantially improved by unifying two complementary principles: (i) a projection-based subspace view that reduces gradient estimation variance by exploiting the intrinsic low-rank structure of model updates, and (ii) Muon-style spectral optimization that applies gradient orthogonalization to extract informative spectral structure from noisy ZO gradients. These findings form a unified framework of subspace gradient orthogonalization, which we instantiate in a new method, ZO-Muon, admitting a natural interpretation as a low-rank Muon optimizer in the ZO setting. Extensive experiments on large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate that ZO-Muon significantly accelerates convergence and achieves a win-win improvement in accuracy and query/runtime efficiency. Notably, compared to the popular MeZO baseline, ZO-Muon requires only 24.7% of the queries to reach the same SST-2 performance for LLM fine-tuning, and improves accuracy by 25.1% on ViT-B fine-tuning on CIFAR-100."}

Therefore, general-domain LLMs may struggle to provide accurate and reliable outputs in this context, leading to increased hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.To address these limitations, this work introduces KG-RAG-a novel framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks. In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models. These results highlight KG-RAG's effectiveness in producing accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios."}

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains. We verified that the resulting controller is robust against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, realizing successful sim-to-real transfer."}

To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma."}

A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact.

CounterFlowNet is trained to sample CFs proportionally to a user-specified reward function that can encode key CF desiderata: validity, sparsity, proximity and plausibility, encouraging high-quality explanations. The sequential formulation yields highly sparse edits, while a unified action space seamlessly supports continuous and categorical features. Moreover, actionability constraints, such as immutability and monotonicity of features, can be enforced at inference time via action masking, without retraining.

We show that this failure stems not merely from limited supervision, but from a structural mismatch between noisy, limited supervision and the highly plastic parameter space of EFMs. To address this challenge, we propose SCOPE, a Structured COnfidence-aware Prototype-guided adaptation framework for EFM fine-tuning. SCOPE follows a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we construct reliable external supervision by learning geometry-regularized task priors, constructing balanced class-level prototypes over the resulting embeddings, and producing confidence-aware pseudo-labels from their agreement to filter unreliable signals on unlabeled data. In the second stage, we introduce ProAdapter, which adapts frozen EEG foundation models via a lightweight adapter conditioned on the structured prototypes. Experiments across three EEG tasks and five foundation model backbones demonstrate that SCOPE consistently achieves strong performance and efficiency under label-limited cross-subject settings."}

While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

Our empirical findings show that the learned latent space is continuous and interpretable while maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions. Pulse families such as higher-order Gaussians trace coherent trajectories, while standardizing the temporal pulse lengths shows a latent organization correlated with pulse energy. Analysis via principal components and Gaussian Mixture Models reveals a well behaved latent geometry, enabling smooth transitions between distinct pulse types via linear interpolation.

Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \\textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a \"human game\" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the \"Multiverse of Human Games\". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines."}

In a recent pioneering paper, Wagner demonstrated how the Deep Cross-Entropy RL method can be applied to tackle various problems from extremal graph theory by reformulating them as combinatorial optimization problems. Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the Turán-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four. Here, we present Reinforcement Learning for Graph Theory (RLGT), a novel RL framework that systematizes the previous work and provides support for both undirected and directed graphs, with or without loops, and with an arbitrary number of edge colors.

This sampling scheme has been recently applied in the context of differentially private optimization (Chua et al., 2024a; Choquette-Choo et al., 2025) and communication-efficient high-dimensional private aggregation (Asi et al., 2025), where it was shown to have utility advantages over the standard Poisson sampling. Theoretical analyses of this sampling scheme (Feldman & Shenfeld, 2025; Dong et al., 2025) lead to bounds that are close to those of Poisson sampling, yet still have two significant shortcomings. First, in many practical settings, the resulting privacy parameters are not tight due to the approximation steps in the analysis. Second, the computed parameters are either the hockey stick or Renyi divergence, both of which introduce overheads when used in privacy loss accounting.\n  In this work, we demonstrate that the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm can be computed efficiently. When applied to the Gaussian mechanism, our results demonstrate that the privacy-utility trade-off for random allocation is at least as good as that of Poisson subsampling. In particular, random allocation is better suited for training via DP-SGD. To support these computations, our work develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on a notion of PLD realization. This notion allows us to extend accurate privacy loss accounting to subsampling which previously required manual noise-mechanism-specific analysis."}

Here, we present CACTUS (Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures), an explainable machine learning framework explicitly designed to address these challenges in small, heterogeneous, and incomplete clinical datasets. CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and systematic feature stability analysis to quantify how consistently informative features are preserved as data quality degrades. Using a real-world haematuria cohort comprising 568 patients evaluated for bladder cancer, we benchmark CACTUS against widely used machine learning approaches, including random forests and gradient boosting methods, under controlled levels of randomly introduced missing data. We demonstrate that CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Our results show that feature stability provides information complementary to conventional performance metrics and is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of machine learning models applied to biomedical data.

In contrast, physics-based simulation models described by ODEs/PDEs remain interpretable, but may have missing or unknown terms, unable to fully describe real-world observations. We bridge this gap with a novel grey-box method that integrates incomplete physics models directly into generative models. Our approach learns dynamics from observational trajectories alone, without ground-truth physics parameters, in a simulation-free manner that avoids scalability and stability issues of Neural ODEs. The core of our method lies in modelling a structured variational distribution within the flow matching framework, by using two latent encodings: one to model the missing stochasticity and multi-modal velocity, and a second to encode physics parameters as a latent variable with a physics-informed prior. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the framework to handle second-order dynamics. Our experiments on representative ODE/PDE problems show that our method performs on par with or superior to fully data-driven approaches and previous grey-box baselines, while preserving the interpretability of the physics model.

To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\\exp(-Θ(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\\exp(-Θ(t/(m^{2}\\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems. In summary, this paper validates that extra optimism is a promising countermeasure against performance degradation caused by feedback delays."}

In this work, we propose to leverage pretrained knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to transform sparse rewards into dense training signals (i.e., the advantage function) through retrospective in-context learning (RICL). We further propose an online learning framework, RICOL, which iteratively refines the policy based on the credit assignment results from RICL. We empirically demonstrate that RICL can accurately estimate the advantage function with limited samples and effectively identify critical states in the environment for temporal credit assignment. Extended evaluation on four BabyAI scenarios show that RICOL achieves comparable convergent performance with traditional online RL algorithms with significantly higher sample efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs for temporal credit assignment, paving the way for more sample-efficient and generalizable RL paradigms."}

The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks. This motivates the use of a random encoder as a reasonable baseline model. We substantiate our observations with an empirical evaluation of three representative ECG pre-training approaches across six evaluation settings: the three standard benchmarks, a structural disease dataset, hemodynamic inference, and patient forecasting."}

We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference.

However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches.

We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling.

We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets.

SMAC avoids valleys between offline and online maxima by regularizing the Q-function during the offline phase to respect a first-order derivative equality between the score of the policy and action-gradient of the Q-function. We experimentally demonstrate that SMAC converges to offline maxima that are connected to better online maxima via paths with monotonically increasing reward found by first-order optimization. SMAC achieves smooth transfer to Soft Actor-Critic and TD3 in 6/6 D4RL tasks. In 4/6 environments, it reduces regret by 34-58% over the best baseline."}

Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier."}

Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier."}

To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features. Our work offers evidence that AI agents are remarkably effective in solving problems that require highly inventive solutions, such as feature engineering."}

We present A.R.I.S. (Automated Recycling Identification System), a low-cost, portable sorter for shredded e-waste that addresses this efficiency gap. The system employs a YOLOx model to classify metals, plastics, and circuit boards in real time, achieving low inference latency with high detection accuracy. Experimental evaluation yielded 90% overall precision, 82.2% mean average precision (mAP), and 84% sortation purity. By integrating deep learning with established sorting methods, A.R.I.S. enhances material recovery efficiency and lowers barriers to advanced recycling adoption.

We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior."}

However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling."}
