Building on this, we present SIEV, a\nstructured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics.\nUnlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model\nreaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate\ndistinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers\nsignificant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated\nbenchmarks like GSM and MMLU. For instance, GPT-5-chat, a recent model, loses\nover 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM. Our findings\nhighlight that adopting a process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach\nenables a deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM\nreasoning."}

Early research has\nprimarily focused on red teaming, which aims to uncover and evaluate\nvulnerabilities and risks of CodeGen models. However, progress on the blue\nteaming side remains limited, as developing defense requires effective semantic\nunderstanding to differentiate the unsafe from the safe. To fill in this gap,\nwe propose BlueCodeAgent, an end-to-end blue teaming agent enabled by automated\nred teaming. Our framework integrates both sides: red teaming generates diverse\nrisky instances, while the blue teaming agent leverages these to detect\npreviously seen and unseen risk scenarios through constitution and code\nanalysis with agentic integration for multi-level defense. Our evaluation\nacross three representative code-related tasks--bias instruction detection,\nmalicious instruction detection, and vulnerable code detection--shows that\nBlueCodeAgent achieves significant gains over the base models and safety\nprompt-based defenses. In particular, for vulnerable code detection tasks,\nBlueCodeAgent integrates dynamic analysis to effectively reduce false\npositives, a challenging problem as base models tend to be over-conservative,\nmisclassifying safe code as unsafe. Overall, BlueCodeAgent achieves an average\n12.7\\% F1 score improvement across four datasets in three tasks, attributed to\nits ability to summarize actionable constitutions that enhance context-aware\nrisk detection. We demonstrate that the red teaming benefits the blue teaming\nby continuously identifying new vulnerabilities to enhance defense performance."}

Extensive experiments across\ndifferent model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated\nselection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning,\nwhile their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further\nsurpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance\nimprovements while maintaining training efficiency."}

Testing these highly\ninterconnected systems presents a challenge due to the need for access to the\nconnected services. Service virtualization has emerged as a widely used\ntechnique to derive service models from recorded interactions, for service\nresponse generation during system testing. Various methods have been proposed\nto emulate actual service behavior based on these interactions, but most fail\nto account for the service's state, which reduces the accuracy of service\nemulation and the realism of the testing environment, especially when dealing\nwith stateful services. This paper proposes an approach to deriving service\nmodels from service interactions, which enhance the accuracy of response\ngeneration by considering service state. This is achieved by uncovering\ncontextual dependencies among interaction messages and analyzing the\nrelationships between message data values.

While\nprior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may\nnaturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output\nfeatures, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form\n\"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English\", (2) absence rules of the form\n\"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English,\" and (3) counting rules that toggle only\nwhen the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.\nAbsence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of\nexemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or\nincomplete explanations.

To\naddress this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds\nexplicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three\nstages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept\nrepresentations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a\ndictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects\nactivating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical\nreasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order\nstructures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on\nmulti-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept\ncues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),\nand context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails).

In SLT, meaning depends on precise\ngrounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because\nthey map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without\nintermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that\nhallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual\ninput. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that\nquantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines\nfeature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is\nmasked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences\nbetween clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a\nsentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure\nof visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks\n(PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our\nresults show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across\ndatasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond\nthese quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded\ntokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when\ncombined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it\nfurther improves hallucination risk estimation.

In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet\nunder-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).\nDNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and\ninter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address\nthe DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first\nestimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences\nvia a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,\nRULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute\nfusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during\ninter-graph discrepancy elimination.

In contrast, representations within most machine learning\nmodels lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces\nthat are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of\nself-attention that turns Transformers into \"Topoformers\" with topographic\norganization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are\narranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given\nkey - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected\nlayer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate\nthe feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment\nclassification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic\norganization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately\nencourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs.\nWe then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with\na masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant\nperforms on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet\nproduces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight\nlinguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain\nresponses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment\nbetween low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and\nhuman brain language network.

This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate\nshallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation\ndepths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an\neffective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based\non our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header\ntokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens\npossess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens\nmid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals\nat any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,\nGemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety\nperformance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters.

We argue that this\nunderestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new\nbackdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of\ntransferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor\ntrigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in\nanticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains\nstealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens\nprovides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using\nT-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable\nbackdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and\nacross four model families of LLMs."}

Our approach employs a\ncompetence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty\n(in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promoting\nreliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system,\nRLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention,\nreducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiC\nbenchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to\n75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%).

In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for\nindustrial asset health, which transfers reasoning capabilities via\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nsmaller, more efficient models (SLMs).

To address this, actor-critic methods are typically\nemployed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,\nand an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output.

Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the\ncomputational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with\ndynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed\nsettings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and\nstep-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed\nmethodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training\nfor LLMs with ultra-long contexts.

These components are designed to\nsynergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads\ninherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models\nwith extensive context lengths.

Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward\nhacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust\nreinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable\npersonalization.

In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations\nof several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and\nnuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models."}
