Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate software development, most studies focus on isolated, single-agent function-level generation. This work examines how process structure and role specialization shape multi-agent LLM workflows for class-level code generation. We simulate a Waterfall-style development cycle covering Requirement, Design, Implementation, and Testing using three LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat, and Claude-3.5-Haiku) on 100 Python tasks from the ClassEval benchmark. Our findings show that multi-agent workflows reorganize, rather than consistently enhance, model performance. Waterfall-style collaboration produces cleaner and more maintainable code but often reduces functional correctness (-37.8\\% for GPT-4o-mini and -39.8\\% for DeepSeek-Chat), with Claude-3.5-Haiku as a notable exception (+9.5\\%). Importantly, process constraints shift failure characteristics: structural issues such as missing code decrease, while semantic and validation errors become more frequent. Among all stages, Testing exerts the strongest influence by improving verification coverage but also introducing new reasoning failures, whereas Requirement and Design have comparatively modest effects. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that software process structure fundamentally alters how LLMs reason, collaborate, and fail, revealing inherent trade-offs between rigid workflow discipline and flexible problem-solving in multi-agent code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u7c7b\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7011\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u91cd\u7ec4\u800c\u975e\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea7\u751f\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7c7b\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u7c7b\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u62df\u7011\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f00\u53d1\u5468\u671f\uff08\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cdLLM\uff08GPT-4o-mini\u3001DeepSeek-Chat\u548cClaude-3.5-Haiku\uff09\u5728ClassEval\u57fa\u51c6\u7684100\u4e2aPython\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f1a\u91cd\u7ec4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u7011\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u964d\u4f4e\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff08GPT-4o-mini\u4e0b\u964d37.8%\uff0cDeepSeek-Chat\u4e0b\u964d39.8%\uff09\uff0c\u800cClaude-3.5-Haiku\u662f\u4f8b\u5916\uff08\u63d0\u53479.5%\uff09\u3002\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u5931\u8d25\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u7ed3\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9519\u8bef\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ed3\u6784\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6539\u53d8\u4e86LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4e25\u683c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7eaa\u5f8b\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

Here we introduce EnvTrace, a simulation-based method that evaluates execution traces to assess semantic code equivalence. EnvTrace is demonstrated with a beamline control-logic digital twin to facilitate the evaluation of instrument control code, with the digital twin itself also enabling the pre-execution validation of live experiments. Over 30 LLMs were evaluated using trace alignment to generate a multi-faceted score for functional correctness across key behavioral dimensions, showing that many top-tier models can approach human-level performance in rapid control-code generation.

However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies. Overall, our findings reveal a mismatch between academic focus, industry priorities, and model performance, highlighting the urgent need to integrate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation pipelines to ensure that future generated code not only passes tests but truly passes with quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u5173\u6ce8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u4e1a\u754c\u66f4\u91cd\u89c6\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u5230LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8LLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4e1a\u754c\u62c5\u5fe7\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e09\u9879\u4e92\u8865\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u5bf9108\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u3001\u4e0e\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\u4fee\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u4e1a\u754c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5f80\u5f80\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u5176\u4ed6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u3001\u884c\u4e1a\u4f18\u5148\u4e8b\u9879\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u5230LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0d\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "topic": "swe application"}}

Advancing such agents requires reproducible evaluation and large-scale training in controllable, diverse, and realistic tool-use environments. However, real-world APIs are limited in availability, domain coverage, and stability, often requiring access keys and imposing rate limits, which render them impractical for stable evaluation or scalable training. To address these challenges, we introduce SynthTools, a flexible and scalable framework for generating synthetic tool ecosystems. Our framework consists of three core components: Tool Generation for automatic and scalable creation of diverse tools, Tool Simulation to emulate realistic tool behaviors, and Tool Audit to ensure correctness and consistency of tool simulation. To illustrate its scalability, we show that SynthTools can readily produce toolsets that span twice as many domains and twice as many tools per domain as prior work. Furthermore, the tool simulation and tool audit components demonstrate strong reliability, achieving $94\\%$ and $99\\%$ accuracy respectively. Finally, we construct downstream tasks from the generated tools that even state-of-the-art models struggle to complete. By enabling scalable, diverse, and reliable tool ecosystems, SynthTools provides a practical path toward large-scale training and stable evaluation of tool-use agents.

However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback.

Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\\%$ to $70\\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting. Finally, we introduce a protocol-level mitigation in which targeted use of structured responses reduces echoing to $9\\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\"\u56de\u58f0\"\u884c\u4e3a\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5373\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u653e\u5f03\u539f\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u800c\u6a21\u4eff\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4e2d\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4e3a5%-70%\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6b21\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u52a0\u5267\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5931\u6548\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u572860\u4e2aAxA\u914d\u7f6e\u30013\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u548c2000+\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u793a\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u7ea7\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u56de\u58f0\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4e2d\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4e3a5%-70%\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4fdd\u630132.8%\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u968f\u63a8\u7406\u52aa\u529b\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u56de\u58f0\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u666e\u904d\u4e14\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5176\u964d\u4f4e\u52309%\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

However, the classical foundations of RL do not account for the risk sensitivity of the objective function, which is critical in various fields, including healthcare and finance.

In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $\u03c4$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). UCB-QRL is an iterative algorithm in which, at each iteration, we first estimate the underlying transition probability and then optimize the quantile value function over a confidence ball around this estimate.

Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression.

Most existing black-box attacks focus on vector-based or discrete-action RL, and their effectiveness on image-based continuous control is limited by the large action space and excessive environment queries. We propose SEBA, a sample-efficient framework for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions, a generative adversarial network that produces visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator, SEBA achieves strong attack performance while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks show that SEBA significantly reduces cumulative rewards, preserves visual fidelity, and greatly decreases environment interactions compared to prior black-box and white-box methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEBA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5f71\u5b50Q\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u6216\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684RL\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u56e0\u5927\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8fc7\u591a\u73af\u5883\u67e5\u8be2\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "SEBA\u96c6\u6210\u5f71\u5b50Q\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\u4ea7\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u5b66\u4e60\u5f71\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728MuJoCo\u548cAtari\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSEBA\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5927\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u548c\u767d\u76d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "conclusion": "SEBA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u89c6\u89c9RL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines.

Accepted at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "AI systems are increasingly able to autonomously conduct realistic software engineering tasks, and may soon be deployed to automate machine learning (ML) R&D itself. Frontier AI systems may be deployed in safety-critical settings, including to help ensure the safety of future systems. Unfortunately, frontier and future systems may not be sufficiently trustworthy, and there is evidence that these systems may even be misaligned with their developers or users. Therefore, we investigate the capabilities of AI agents to act against the interests of their users when conducting ML engineering, by sabotaging ML models, sandbagging their performance, and subverting oversight mechanisms. First, we extend MLE-Bench, a benchmark for realistic ML tasks, with code-sabotage tasks such as implanting backdoors and purposefully causing generalisation failures. Frontier agents make meaningful progress on our sabotage tasks. In addition, we study agent capabilities to sandbag on MLE-Bench. Agents can calibrate their performance to specified target levels below their actual capability. To mitigate sabotage, we use LM monitors to detect suspicious agent behaviour, and we measure model capability to sabotage and sandbag without being detected by these monitors. Overall, monitors are capable at detecting code-sabotage attempts but our results suggest that detecting sandbagging is more difficult. Additionally, aggregating multiple monitor predictions works well, but monitoring may not be sufficiently reliable to mitigate sabotage in high-stakes domains.

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain.

However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts.

Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHint-Practice Reasoning (HPR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5927\u7684hinter\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u7531\u9ad8\u6548\u7684practitioner\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u4e3b\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR)\u6307\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e72\u9884\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7a77\u4e3e\u91c7\u6837\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u6602\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u5173\u952e\u6807\u8bb0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "HPR\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1ahinter\uff08\u5f3a\u5927LLM\uff09\u5728\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\uff0cpractitioner\uff08\u9ad8\u6548\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u6267\u884c\u4e3b\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DIR\u6307\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e72\u9884\u70b9\u5e76\u5728\u6811\u72b6\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHPR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6548\u7387-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548cMCTS\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ec5\u89e3\u78011/5\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u5f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad85.1%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684FLOPs\u3002", "conclusion": "HPR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

In GRPO, prompts are answered by the model and, through reinforcement learning, preferred completions are learnt. Owing to the small communication volume, GRPO is inherently suitable for decentralised training as the prompts can be concurrently answered by multiple nodes and then exchanged in the forms of strings. In this work, we present the first adversarial attack in decentralised GRPO. We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations. We propose two ways to defend against these attacks, depending on whether all users train the same model or different models.

Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety.

We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance.

Across a suite of robotic manipulation tasks, TD-ES raises success rates by 26.5% relative to PPO and greatly reduces variance, offering a simple, compute-light path to reliable refinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTriangular-Distribution ES (TD-ES)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u754c\u4e09\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u79e9\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7684\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u540e\u671f\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u5e38\u5e38\u53d7\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4f4e\u4fe1\u53f7\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u963b\u788d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7cbe\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1aPPO\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u63a5TD-ES\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002TD-ES\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u754c\u53cd\u4e09\u89d2\u6270\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u5fc3\u79e9\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cTD-ES\u76f8\u6bd4PPO\u5c06\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8626.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "TD-ES\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5c0f\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u7cbe\u70bc\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65e9\u671f\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u540e\u671f\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "topic": "agentic reinforcement learning"}}

In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.\n  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates.

We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6982\u7387\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6218\u7565\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6218\u7565\u73af\u5883\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e38\u89c1\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5982\u5171\u540c\u5148\u9a8c\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u81ea\u5229\u5047\u8bbe\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b2\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b4\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u662f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6982\u7387\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6218\u7565\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5904\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "DemoTuner\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u6f14\u793a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u914d\u7f6e\u8c03\u4f18\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u6539\u8fdbRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728MySQL\u548cPostgreSQL\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u914d\u7f6e\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u7684\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u8ba9LLM\u4ece\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6761\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u63d0\u793a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5HA-DDPGfD\u3002", "result": "\u5728MySQL\u548cPostgreSQL\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDemoTuner\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u4f18\u6210\u672c\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eDB-BERT\u3001GPTuner\u548cCDBTune\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DemoTuner\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u6f14\u793a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u914d\u7f6e\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u573a\u666f\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "topic": "agentic reinforcement learning"}}

However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.\n  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.\n  We further investigate the $\u0394$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $\u0394$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME.

Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ffd\u89c6\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u6216\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u836f\u7269\u6ee5\u7528\u548c\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df", "method": "\u5c06\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5e73\u8861\u77ed\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7528\u6237\u798f\u7949\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6355\u6349\u60c5\u7eea\u51c6\u5907\u5ea6\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u6ce2\u52a8", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u60c5\u611f\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u5b89\u5168", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u548c\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6cbb\u7597\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4eba\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840", "topic": "agentic reinforcement learning"}}

Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase it to variations in structure and format, while it does not consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0b\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56fe\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u7f6e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u91cd\u7d22\u5f15\u3001\u8fb9\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6216\u683c\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56fe\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u4e3a\u8282\u70b9\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u8fb9\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e09\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8c31\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fae\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1) \u66f4\u5927\u7684\uff08\u672a\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff1b2) \u5fae\u8c03\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8282\u70b9\u91cd\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b3) \u5fae\u8c03\u5e76\u672a\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u67d0\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u9762\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "topic": "agent analysis"}}

Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information. We also conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DeMABAR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u5c40\u8150\u8d25\u9884\u7b97\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u5fa1\u8150\u8d25\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86DeMABAR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9c81\u68d2\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8150\u8d25\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u5c40\u8150\u8d25\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eDeMABAR\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u4e2a\u4f53\u9057\u61be\u9650\u5236\u5728\u8150\u8d25\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u9644\u52a0\u9879\u5185\uff0c\u5728\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DeMABAR\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "topic": "agentic reinforcement learning"}}
