Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark. By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, we can democratize LLM deployment -- ensuring that optimization reduces inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them."}

Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \\r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings.

Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers."}

Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation. Validated on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, our framework effectively balances knowledge retention and adaptability, achieving superior performance in cross-subject continual EEG decoding tasks."}

Yet a core requirement remains unmet: ensuring that generated code is secure without compromising its functional correctness. Existing benchmarks and evaluations for secure code generation fall short-many measure only vulnerability reduction, disregard correctness preservation, or evaluate security and functionality on separate datasets, violating the fundamental need for simultaneous joint evaluation. We present DUALGAUGE, the first fully automated benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the security and correctness of LLM-generated code in unison. Given the lack of datasets enabling joint evaluation of secure code generation, we also present DUALGAUGE-BENCH, a curated benchmark suite of diverse coding tasks, each paired with manually validated test suites for both security and functionality, designed for full coverage of specification requirements. At the core of DUALGAUGE is an agentic program executor, which runs a program against given tests in sandboxed environments, and an LLM-based evaluator, which assesses both correctness and vulnerability behavior against expected outcomes. We rigorously evaluated and ensured the quality of DUALGAUGE-BENCH and the accuracy of DUALGAUGE, and applied DUALGAUGE to benchmarking ten leading LLMs on DUALGAUGE-BENCH across thousands of test scenarios. Our results reveal critical gaps in correct and secure code generation by these LLMs, for which our open-source system and datasets help accelerate progress via reproducible, scalable, and rigorous evaluation."}

Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline."}

It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT. Our results provide a new case in which Hopfield networks can be a useful perspective for improving the Transformer architecture."}

However, their integration into product development remains fragmented. This fragmentation stems from uncertainty, particularly the lack of clarity on what types of DDMs to use and when to employ them across the product development lifecycle. To address this, a necessary first step is to investigate the usage of DDM in engineering design by identifying which methods are being used, at which development stages, and for what application. This paper presents a PRISMA systematic literature review. The V-model as a product development framework was adopted and simplified into four stages: system design, system implementation, system integration, and validation. A structured search across Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore (2014--2024) retrieved 1{,}689 records. After screening, 114 publications underwent full-text analysis. Findings show that machine learning (ML) and statistical methods dominate current practice, whereas deep learning (DL), though still less common, exhibits a clear upward trend in adoption. Additionally, supervised learning, clustering, regression analysis, and surrogate modeling are prevalent in design, implementation, and integration system stages but contributions to validation remain limited. Key challenges in existing applications include limited model interpretability, poor cross-stage traceability, and insufficient validation under real-world conditions. Additionally, it highlights key limitations and opportunities such as the need for interpretable hybrid models. This review is a first step toward design-stage guidelines; a follow-up synthesis should map computer science algorithms to engineering design problems and activities."}

Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \\textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \\textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \\textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection.

In privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare or finance, access to the original training data is often restricted post-deployment due to regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). This paper proposes a Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework to bridge the gap between model compression and data privacy. We utilize DeepInversion to synthesize privacy-preserving ``dream'' images from the pre-trained teacher model by inverting Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. These synthetic images serve as a transfer set to distill knowledge from the original teacher to the pruned student network. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 across various architectures (ResNet, MobileNet, VGG) demonstrate that our method significantly recovers accuracy lost during pruning without accessing a single real data point."}

We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum.

A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC.

A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery.

Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.\n  In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.\n  We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings."}

While models exhibit a solid baseline understanding of both concepts in ideal conditions, their practical knowledge is fragile and highly asymmetrical. Reasoning about coupling proves brittle; performance collapses in noisy, open-ended scenarios, with F1 scores dropping by over $50\\%$. In contrast, the models' analysis of cohesion is remarkably robust to internal noise in guided tasks, showing little performance degradation. However, this resilience also fails when all guidance is removed. Reasoning-trace analysis confirms these failure modes, revealing \\textit{cognitive shortcutting} for coupling versus a more exhaustive (yet still failing) analysis for cohesion.

Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes.

For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines."}

However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training."}

However, their embedded knowledge is constrained by the timeliness of training data, which often includes code using deprecated APIs. Consequently, LLMs frequently generate deprecated APIs that will no longer be supported in future versions of third-party libraries. While retraining LLMs on updated codebases could refresh their API knowledge, this approach is computationally expensive. Recently, lightweight model editing methods have emerged to efficiently correct specific knowledge in LLMs. However, it remains unclear whether these methods can effectively update deprecated API knowledge and enable edited models to generate up-to-date APIs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study applying 10 state-of-the-art model editing techniques to update deprecated API knowledge in three LLMs: Qwen2.5-Coder, StarCoder2, and DeepSeek-Coder. We introduce EDAPIBench, a dedicated benchmark featuring over 70 deprecated APIs from 8 popular Python libraries, with more than 3,000 editing instances. Our results show that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method AdaLoRA achieves the best performance in enabling edited models to generate correct, up-to-date APIs, but falls short in Specificity (i.e., the editing influences untargeted knowledge). To resolve this, we propose AdaLoRA-L, which defines \"Common API Layers\" (layers within the LLMs with high importance across all APIs, storing general knowledge and excluded from editing) and restricts edits exclusively to \"Specific API Layers\" (layers with high importance only for the target API, storing the API-specific knowledge). Experimental results demonstrate that AdaLoRA-L significantly improves Specificity while maintaining comparable performance across other evaluation metrics."}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback.

This paper presents a large-scale study of location-based Android app differentiation, uncovering two important and underexamined phenomena with security and fairness implications. First, we introduce GeoTwins: apps that are functionally similar and share branding but are released under different package names across countries. Despite their similarity, GeoTwins often diverge in requested permissions, third-party libraries, and privacy disclosures. Second, we examine the Android App Bundle ecosystem and reveal unexpected regional differences in supposedly consistent base.apk files. Contrary to common assumptions, even base.apk files vary by region, exposing hidden customizations that may affect app behavior or security.\n  These discrepancies have concrete consequences. Geographically distinct variants can lead the same app to be labeled benign in one malware study but suspicious in another, depending on the region of download. Such hidden variation undermines reproducibility and introduces geographic bias into assessments of security, privacy, and functionality. It also raises ethical concerns about transparency and consent: visually identical Google Play listings may mask subtle but important differences.\n  To study these issues, we built a distributed app collection pipeline spanning multiple regions and analyzed thousands of apps.

While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models.

Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths.

Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\\%$ to just $4\\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration.

The CVAE encodes historical trajectories and map information from large-scale naturalistic datasets to learn latent traffic structures, enabling the generation of physically consistent base scenarios. Building on this, the LLM acts as an adversarial reasoning engine, parsing unstructured scene descriptions into domain-specific loss functions and dynamically guiding scenario generation across varying risk levels. This knowledge-driven optimization balances realism with controllability, ensuring that generated scenarios remain both plausible and risk-sensitive. Extensive experiments in CARLA and SMARTS demonstrate that our framework substantially increases the coverage of high-risk and long-tail events, improves consistency between simulated and real-world traffic distributions, and exposes autonomous driving systems to interactions that are significantly more challenging than those produced by existing rule- or data-driven methods.

Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs."}

Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems, such as GitHub Copilot's agent mode, promise to automate complex development workflows through coordinated reasoning, code generation, and tool interaction. This paper presents the first empirical study on how state-of-the-art multi-agent systems perform in dataset adaptation tasks. We evaluate Copilot, backed by GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4, on adapting SE research artifacts from benchmark repositories including ROCODE and LogHub2.0. Through a five-stage evaluation pipeline (file comprehension, code editing, command generation, validation, and final execution), we measure success rates, analyze failure patterns, and assess prompt-based interventions designed to enhance agent performance. Results show that current systems can identify key files and generate partial adaptations but rarely produce functionally correct implementations. Prompt-level interventions, especially providing execution error messages and reference code, substantially improve structural similarity to ground truth (from 7.25% to 67.14%), highlighting the importance of contextual and feedback-driven guidance. Our findings reveal both the promise and limitations of today's multi-agent LLM systems for dataset adaptation, and suggest concrete directions for building more reliable, self-correcting agents in future SE research."}

While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks.

Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources."}

To analyze the state of the art in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications published between May 2021 and August 2025. We propose a unified taxonomy based on the unit test generation lifecycle that treats LLMs as stochastic generators requiring systematic engineering constraints.

It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute \"delta\" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery."}

Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets.

To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO."}

Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA."}

Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework."}

Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter σ. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest.

Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models."}

We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy).

We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \\emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \\emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation."}

It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.\n  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem."}

Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC. The proposed integrity framework, therefore, offers a task-agnostic and interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic-graph representation quality, providing more explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design."}

We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order.

Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling.

Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives."}

Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency.

Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\\!=\\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup."}

We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2).

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems."}

The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement."}

However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness."}

With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks."}

While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses."}

Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a \"Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia\" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale.

As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech."}

AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures.

However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions. Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game \"Crafter\" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."}

Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search."}

While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings.

Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting \"thoughts\" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether \"training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences.\" We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency."}

Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance.

We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines."}

We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference.

This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average.

Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops.

This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch."}

To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance."}

In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy. Our findings show that AI can convincingly produce poetry even in a morphologically complex, low-resource (with respect of the training data of AI models) Slavic language such as Czech.

Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments.

However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses \"minimum group confidence\" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research."}

We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky."}

While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns.

Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the \"user-item decoupling\" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments.

However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality."}

Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation.

A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs."}

SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles.

While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation."}

In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension."}

This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes."}

The query and key weights are particularly problematic, as they tend to grow large without any intervention. Applying normalization to queries and keys, known as `QK norm', fixes stability issues in practice, but is not always applicable. For example, QK norm is not compatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) because QK norm requires full materialization of queries and keys during inference, which is not done in MLA. In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention."}

AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC.

However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions."}

While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns.

We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability.

We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results. An open-source implementation will be available soon."}

Current approaches to learning classifiers in strategic settings are focused primarily on the linear setting, but in many cases non-linear classifiers are more suitable. A central limitation to progress for non-linear classifiers arises from the inability to compute best responses in these settings. We present a novel method for computing the best response by optimising the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective. We demonstrate that our method reproduces best responses in linear settings, identifying key weaknesses in existing approaches. We present further results demonstrating our method can be straight-forwardly applied to non-linear classifier settings, where it is useful for both evaluation and training."}

The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction."}

Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics."}

Digital forensics is a fundamental concept of learning and identifying, detecting, and mitigating such security incidents. This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation. The results indicate that cloud services are the best backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, which allows energy utilities to achieve a fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response."}

Running small-scale ablation experiments on key innovations from this time period, we are able to account for less than 10x of these gains. Surveying the broader literature, we estimate that additional innovations not included in our ablations account for less than 10x, yielding a total under 100x. This leads us to conduct scaling experiments, which reveal that much of this efficiency gap can be explained by algorithms with scale-dependent efficiency improvements. In particular, we conduct scaling experiments between LSTMs and Transformers, finding exponent differences in their compute-optimal scaling law while finding little scaling difference for many other innovations. These experiments demonstrate that - contrary to standard assumptions - an algorithm's efficiency gains are tied to compute scale. Using experimental extrapolation and literature estimates, we account for 6,930x efficiency gains over the same time period, with the scale-dependent LSTM-to-Transformer transition accounting for the majority of gains. Our results indicate that algorithmic progress for small models has been far slower than previously assumed, and that measures of algorithmic efficiency are strongly reference-dependent."}

We find that KAG emerges during training and appears consistently across spatial scales, from local 7-pixel neighborhoods to the full 28x28 image. This scale-agnostic property holds across different training procedures: both standard training and training with spatial augmentation produce the same qualitative pattern. These findings reveal that neural networks spontaneously develop organized, scale-invariant geometric structure during learning on realistic high-dimensional data."}

Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.

However, many real-world reasoning-intensive tasks lack verifiers, despite offering abundant expert demonstrations that remain under-utilized for reasoning-focused training. We introduce RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization) that learns strong reasoning capabilities from only expert demonstrations via Inverse Reinforcement Learning. Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks -- Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing -- and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks. These results demonstrate that our method effectively elicits strong reasoning performance from expert demonstrations alone, enabling robust reasoning learning even when task-specific verifiers are unavailable."}

The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we propose a formal reduction of the multi-turn RL problem into a sequence of single-turn RLHF-style problems. This is achieved by setting a learned multi-turn Q-function as the reward model for the single-turn problem. We demonstrate and prove a key insight: solving this single-turn RL problem with standard token-level PPO is equivalent to a policy improvement step within the multi-turn problem. This insight naturally leads to Iterative PPO, a batch online policy iteration algorithm that alternates between fitting Q-functions from logged conversation trajectories and improving the policy. A major practical advantage is that Iterative PPO directly leverages stable, off-the-shelf single-turn RLHF tools, making it straightforward to implement. Our method occupies a middle ground between fully online and fully offline approaches, retaining the adaptability of online updates while gaining the stability benefits of offline training."}
