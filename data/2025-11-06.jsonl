This architecture maintains focused attention within agent\ncontexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models\nand 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.\nFirst, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the\nstrongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model\nscale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and\nconditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent\neffectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev\n20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits\npersist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%\ndiscovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning\nenhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%\nfor analysis) requires model-aware architecture design.

Differential fuzzing, in\nparticular, operates as a guided randomized search, aiming to find (similar)\ninputs that lead to a maximum difference in software outputs or their\nbehaviors. However, fuzzing, as a dynamic analysis, lacks any guarantees on the\nabsence of bugs: from a differential fuzzing campaign that has observed no bugs\n(or a minimal difference), what is the risk of observing a bug (or a larger\ndifference) if we run the fuzzer for one or more steps?\n  This paper investigates the application of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to\naddress the risk of missing or underestimating bugs in differential fuzzing.\nThe key observation is that differential fuzzing as a random process resembles\nthe maximum distribution of observed differences. Hence, EVT, a branch of\nstatistics dealing with extreme values, is an ideal framework to analyze the\ntail of the differential fuzzing campaign to contain the risk. We perform\nexperiments on a set of real-world Java libraries and use differential fuzzing\nto find information leaks via side channels in these libraries.

Our\nassessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software\nquality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the\ncontribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that\nRefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a\nmedian of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a\nmedian of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and\nthe search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a\nmedian F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively. Compared to single-agent\napproaches, RefAgent improves the median unit test pass rate by 64.7% and the\nmedian compilation success rate by 40.1%. These findings highlight the promise\nof multi-agent architectures in advancing automated software refactoring."}

Studies have shown that\nwhen human children learn language, they consistently favor hypotheses based on\nhierarchical syntactic rules without ever encountering disambiguating examples.\nA recent line of work has inquired as to whether common neural network\narchitectures share this bias, finding that they do so only under special\nconditions: when syntactically supervised, when pre-trained on massive corpora,\nor when trained long past convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the\nfirst time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in\nhuman-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements:\nstack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer,\nsimple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack\nof Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed\nby DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic\nstacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question\nformation task.

This study proposes a machine learning-driven framework\nfor (1) detecting malicious cyberattacks and (2) identifying faulty device\nanomalies, leveraging a dataset of 200,000 records. Eight machine learning\nmodels are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning\n(XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised\nlearning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph\nNeural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The\ncomprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score,\nprecision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost\nachieved 99\\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly\ndetection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively.\nLSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency. For\nattack detection, KNN achieved near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score\nwith the lowest computational cost (0.05s), followed by VAE at 97% accuracy.\nGAN showed the highest computational cost with lowest accuracy and ROC-AUC.\nThese findings enhance IoT-enabled healthcare security through effective\nanomaly detection strategies. By improving early detection of cyber threats and\ndevice failures, this framework has the potential to prevent data breaches,\nminimize system downtime, and ensure the continuous and safe operation of\nmedical devices, ultimately safeguarding patient health and trust in IoT-driven\nhealthcare solutions."}

We introduce Behavior-Adaptive\nQ-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable\ntransition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit\nbehavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency\nsignal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that\n(i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is\nhigh, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online\nexperience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation\nfrom out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and\naccelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ\nconsistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving\nfaster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance. Our\nresults demonstrate that implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and\npractical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment."}

Under Review", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a\npowerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using\npolicy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods\ntypically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each\nprompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),\nreducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.\n  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages\nfor each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we\npropose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt\nmeans to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --\nparticularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we\nconstruct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance\npolicy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a\ndrop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no\nadditional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines\nconsistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to\nlower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability."}
