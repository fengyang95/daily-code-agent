Unlike traditional generation tasks where all tokens are uniformly important, CoT emphasizes the final answer, rendering conventional KV compression strategies ineffective. In this paper, we present Crystal-KV, an efficient KV cache management framework tailored for CoT reasoning. Our key insight is the answer-first principle. By mapping answer preferences into think-stage attention map, we distinguish between SlipKV, which mainly maintains the reasoning flow but may occasionally introduce misleading context, and CrystalKV, which truly contributes to the correctness of the final answer. Next, we propose an attention-based Least Recently Frequently Used algorithm. It precisely identifies when a SlipKV entry's utility expires and evicts it, retaining CrystalKV without disrupting reasoning flow. Finally, we introduce an adaptive cache budget allocation algorithm. Based on the dynamic proportion of CrystalKV, it estimates the importance of each layer/head and adjusts the KV cache budget during inference, amplifying critical components to improve budget utilization. Results show that Crystal-KV achieves state-of-the-art KV cache compression, significantly improves throughput, and enables faster response time, while maintaining, or even improving, answer accuracy for CoT reasoning."}

Most existing RM evaluations rely on static, pre-annotated preference datasets, which provide limited coverage and often fail to faithfully assess generalization in open-world settings. We introduce Pairwise Maximum Discrepancy Competition (PMDC), a dynamic and annotation-efficient framework for evaluating RM generalization using a large, unlabeled, open-domain prompt pool. PMDC actively selects prompt--response pairs that maximize disagreement between two RMs, yielding a compact set of highly contentious test cases. These cases are adjudicated by an oracle, and the resulting outcomes are aggregated via a Bradley--Terry model to produce a global ranking and pairwise win-rate landscape of RMs. We apply PMDC to re-evaluate 10 representative RMs and observe substantial rank reshuffling compared with conventional benchmarks. Qualitative analyses further uncover systematic generalization failures, providing valuable insights for improving reward modeling."}

However, current NER models typically output a single predicted label sequence without any accompanying measure of uncertainty, leaving downstream applications vulnerable to cascading errors. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for adapting sequence-labeling-based NER models to produce uncertainty-aware prediction sets. These prediction sets are collections of full-sentence labelings that are guaranteed to contain the correct labeling with a user-specified confidence level. This approach serves a role analogous to confidence intervals in classical statistics by providing formal guarantees about the reliability of model predictions. Our method builds on conformal prediction, which offers finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions. We design efficient nonconformity scoring functions to construct efficient, well-calibrated prediction sets that support both unconditional and class-conditional coverage. This framework accounts for heterogeneity across sentence length, language, entity type, and number of entities within a sentence. Empirical experiments on four NER models across three benchmark datasets demonstrate the broad applicability, validity, and efficiency of the proposed methods."}

Existing approaches, from fine-tuned transformers to large language models, apply a uniform reasoning strategy to all inputs, struggling to address the diverse analytical demands of sarcasm. These demands range from modeling contextual expectation violations to requiring external knowledge grounding or recognizing specific rhetorical patterns. To address this limitation, we introduce RAM-SD, a Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Agent framework for Sarcasm Detection. The framework operates through four stages: (1) contextual retrieval grounds the query in both sarcastic and non-sarcastic exemplars; (2) a meta-planner classifies the sarcasm type and selects an optimal reasoning plan from a predefined set; (3) an ensemble of specialized agents performs complementary, multi-view analysis; and (4) an integrator synthesizes these analyses into a final, interpretable judgment with a natural language explanation.

To bridge this gap, we present YASA (Yet Another Static Analyzer), a unified multi-language static taint analysis framework designed for industrial-scale deployment. Specifically, YASA introduces the Unified Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST) that provides a unified abstraction for compatibility across diverse programming languages. Building on the UAST, YASA performs point-to analysis and taint propagation, leveraging a unified semantic model to manage language-agnostic constructs, while incorporating language-specific semantic models to handle other unique language features. When compared to 6 single- and 2 multi-language static analyzers on an industry-standard benchmark, YASA consistently outperformed all baselines across Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go. In real-world deployment within Ant Group, YASA analyzed over 100 million lines of code across 7.3K internal applications. It identified 314 previously unknown taint paths, with 92 of them confirmed as 0-day vulnerabilities. All vulnerabilities were responsibly reported, with 76 already patched by internal development teams, demonstrating YASA's practical effectiveness for securing large-scale industrial software systems."}

In computational linguistics, fear is primarily studied as an emotion, but not as a distinct form of speech. Fear speech content is widespread and growing, and often outperforms hate-speech content in reach and engagement because it appears \"civiler\" and evades moderation. Yet the computational study of fear speech remains fragmented and under-resourced. This can be understood by recognizing that fear speech is a phenomenon shaped by contributions from multiple disciplines. In this paper, we bridge cross-disciplinary perspectives by comparing theories of fear from Psychology, Political science, Communication science, and Linguistics. Building on this, we review existing definitions. We follow up with a survey of datasets from related research areas and propose a taxonomy that consolidates different dimensions of fear for studying fear speech. By reviewing current datasets and defining core concepts, our work offers both theoretical and practical guidance for creating datasets and advancing fear speech research."}

Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduces trainable parameters by factorizing weight updates, yet the underlying dense weights still impose high storage and computation costs. Magnitude-based pruning can yield sparse models but typically degrades LoRA's performance when applied naively. In this paper, we introduce SALR (Sparsity-Aware Low-Rank Representation), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that unifies low-rank adaptation with sparse pruning under a rigorous mean-squared-error framework. We prove that statically pruning only the frozen base weights minimizes the pruning error bound, and we recover the discarded residual information via a truncated-SVD low-rank adapter, which provably reduces per-entry MSE by a factor of $(1 - r/\\min(d,k))$. To maximize hardware efficiency, we fuse multiple low-rank adapters into a single concatenated GEMM, and we adopt a bitmap-based encoding with a two-stage pipelined decoding + GEMM design to achieve true model compression and speedup. Empirically, SALR attains 50\\% sparsity on various LLMs while matching the performance of LoRA on GSM8K and MMLU, reduces model size by $2\\times$, and delivers up to a $1.7\\times$ inference speedup."}

These systems differ fundamentally from traditional machine learning models, both in architecture and deployment, introducing unique AI safety challenges, including goal misalignment, compounding decision errors, and coordination risks among interacting agents, that necessitate embedding interpretability and explainability by design to ensure traceability and accountability across their autonomous behaviors. Current interpretability techniques, developed primarily for static models, show limitations when applied to agentic systems. The temporal dynamics, compounding decisions, and context-dependent behaviors of agentic systems demand new analytical approaches. This paper assesses the suitability and limitations of existing interpretability methods in the context of agentic systems, identifying gaps in their capacity to provide meaningful insight into agent decision-making. We propose future directions for developing interpretability techniques specifically designed for agentic systems, pinpointing where interpretability is required to embed oversight mechanisms across the agent lifecycle from goal formation, through environmental interaction, to outcome evaluation. These advances are essential to ensure the safe and accountable deployment of agentic AI systems."}

The statistical and temporal validity of this disaggregation was assessed using a high-resolution reference dataset from the state of Sao Paulo (2024), which simultaneously provides monthly and epidemiological-week counts, enabling a direct comparison of three strategies: linear interpolation, jittering, and cubic spline. Results indicated that cubic spline interpolation achieved the highest adherence to the reference data, and this strategy was therefore adopted to generate weekly series for the 1999 to 2021 period. In addition to hospitalization time series, the dataset includes a comprehensive set of explanatory variables commonly used in epidemiological and environmental modeling, such as demographic density, CH4, CO2, and NO2 emissions, poverty and urbanization indices, maximum temperature, mean monthly precipitation, minimum relative humidity, and municipal latitude and longitude, following the same temporal disaggregation scheme to ensure multivariate compatibility.

This paper provides empirical validation of this framework through three experiments. First, we demonstrate the equivalence between recursive Datalog rules and iterative tensor contractions by computing the transitive closure of a biblical genealogy graph containing 1,972 individuals and 1,727 parent-child relationships, converging in 74 iterations to discover 33,945 ancestor relationships. Second, we implement reasoning in embedding space by training a neural network with learnable transformation matrices, demonstrating successful zero-shot compositional inference on held-out queries.

Despite the dominance of deep learning techniques in this field, the internal mechanisms enabling Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to solve intent detection tasks are poorly understood. In this work, we apply dynamical systems theory to analyze how RNN architectures address this problem, using both the balanced SNIPS and the imbalanced ATIS datasets. By interpreting sentences as trajectories in the hidden state space, we first show that on the balanced SNIPS dataset, the network learns an ideal solution: the state space, constrained to a low-dimensional manifold, is partitioned into distinct clusters corresponding to each intent. The application of this framework to the imbalanced ATIS dataset then reveals how this ideal geometric solution is distorted by class imbalance, causing the clusters for low-frequency intents to degrade. Our framework decouples geometric separation from readout alignment, providing a novel, mechanistic explanation for real world performance disparities. These findings provide new insights into RNN dynamics, offering a geometric interpretation of how dataset properties directly shape a network's computational solution."}

However, empirical evidence shows that many of these systems suffer from fundamental reliability issues, including hallucinated actions, unexecutable plans and brittle coordination. Crucially, these failures do not stem from limitations of the underlying models themselves, but from the absence of explicit architectural structure linking goals, capabilities and execution. This paper presents a declarative, model-independent architectural layer for grounded agentic workflows that addresses this gap. The proposed layer, referred to as DALIA (Declarative Agentic Layer for Intelligent Agents), formalises executable capabilities, exposes tasks through a declarative discovery protocol, maintains a federated directory of agents and their execution resources, and constructs deterministic task graphs grounded exclusively in declared operations. By enforcing a clear separation between discovery, planning and execution, the architecture constrains agent behaviour to a verifiable operational space, reducing reliance on speculative reasoning and free-form coordination. We present the architecture and design principles of the proposed layer and illustrate its operation through a representative task-oriented scenario, demonstrating how declarative grounding enables reproducible and verifiable agentic workflows across heterogeneous environments."}

To address these challenges, we propose MathMixup, a novel data synthesis paradigm that systematically generates high-quality, difficulty-controllable mathematical reasoning problems through hybrid and decomposed strategies. Automated self-checking and manual screening are incorporated to ensure semantic clarity and a well-structured difficulty gradient in the synthesized data. Building on this, we construct the MathMixupQA dataset and design a curriculum learning strategy that leverages these graded problems, supporting flexible integration with other datasets. Experimental results show that MathMixup and its curriculum learning strategy significantly enhance the mathematical reasoning performance of LLMs. Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B achieves an average score of 52.6\\% across seven mathematical benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods.

We introduce a controlled evaluation framework using three leading models -- GPT-4o, Llama-3.3, and Mistral-Large 2.1 -- across two generation settings: Standalone Generation, which isolates intrinsic demographic effects, and Context-Rich Generation, which incorporates thematic and regional context to emulate realistic targeting. We evaluate generated messages along three dimensions: lexical content, language style, and persuasive framing. We instantiate this framework on climate communication and find consistent age- and gender-based asymmetries across models: male- and youth-targeted messages emphasize agency, innovation, and assertiveness, while female- and senior-targeted messages stress warmth, care, and tradition. Contextual prompts systematically amplify these disparities, with persuasion scores significantly higher for messages tailored to younger or male audiences. Our findings demonstrate how demographic stereotypes can surface and intensify in LLM-generated targeted communication, underscoring the need for bias-aware generation pipelines and transparent auditing frameworks that explicitly account for demographic conditioning in socially sensitive applications."}

Early diagnosis is essential to mitigate the progressive deterioration of patients' quality of life. The most characteristic motor symptoms are very mild in the early stages, making diagnosis difficult. Recent studies have shown that the use of patient voice recordings can aid in early diagnosis. Although the analysis of such recordings is costly from a clinical point of view, advances in machine learning techniques are making the processing of this type of data increasingly accurate and efficient. Vocal recordings contain many features, but it is not known whether all of them are relevant for diagnosing the disease.\n  This paper proposes the use of different types of machine learning models combined with feature selection methods to detect the disease. The selection techniques allow to reduce the number of features used by the classifiers by determining which ones provide the most information about the problem. The results show that machine learning methods, in particular neural networks, are suitable for PD classification and that the number of features can be significantly reduced without affecting the performance of the models."}

We develop a minimal and calibratable theory that predicts these regimes from three binding constraints of modern agent stacks: finite context windows, lossy inter-agent communication, and shared failures among similar agents. Each leaf agent is summarized by a compute-performance scaling exponent $β$; communication is captured by a message-length fidelity curve $γ(m)$; dependence is captured by an effective shared-error correlation $ρ$; and a context window $W$ imposes hard fan-in limits that make hierarchy necessary. For binary success/failure tasks with majority aggregation, we prove a sharp phase transition for deep $b$-ary trees with correlated inputs and lossy communication: a single scalar $α_ρ$ (combining $γ(m)$, $ρ$, and fan-in $b$) determines whether weak signal is amplified to a nontrivial fixed point or washed out to chance. In the amplifying regime, we derive an organization exponent $s$ and show that budgeted synergy, i.e., outperforming the best single agent under the same total budget, occurs exactly when $s>β$, yielding closed-form compute allocation rules and explicit budget thresholds. We further characterize saturation via a mixing depth and provide a conservative clipped predictor that remains accurate across growth and saturation. A continuous-performance warm-up gives closed-form risks for star, chain, and tree organizations, making correlation- and communication-induced floors explicit and exposing the core design trade-offs in a smooth setting. Finally, we validate the predicted phase boundaries in controlled synthetic simulations and show how the same mechanisms explain the dominant bottlenecks reported in recent large-scale matched-budget studies of LLM agent-system scaling."}

While parsers prioritize semantic accuracy (i.e., event identification), they often obscure deep correlations between static templates and dynamic variables that are critical for storage efficiency. In this paper, we investigate this misalignment through a comprehensive empirical study and propose LogPrism, a framework that bridges the gap via unified redundancy encoding. Rather than relying on a rigid pre-parsing step, LogPrism dynamically integrates structural extraction with variable encoding by constructing a Unified Redundancy Tree (URT). This hierarchical approach effectively mines \"structure+variable\" co-occurrence patterns, capturing deep contextual redundancies while accelerating processing through pre-emptive pattern encoding. Extensive experiments on 16 benchmark datasets confirm that LogPrism establishes a new state-of-the-art. It achieves the highest compression ratio on 13 datasets, surpassing leading baselines by margins of 4.7% to 80.9%, while delivering superior throughput at 29.87 MB/s (1.68$\\times$~43.04$\\times$ faster than competitors).

Despite strong in-sample performance, these models often degrade when confronted with evolving real-world market regimes, which can shift dramatically due to macroeconomic changes-e.g., monetary policy updates or unanticipated fluctuations in participant behavior. We identify two challenges that perpetuate this mismatch: (1) insufficient robustness in existing policy against uncertainties in high-level market fluctuations, and (2) the absence of a realistic and diverse simulation environment for training, leading to policy overfitting. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian Robust Framework that systematically integrates a macro-conditioned generative model with robust policy learning. On the data side, to generate realistic and diverse data, we propose a macro-conditioned GAN-based generator that leverages macroeconomic indicators as primary control variables, synthesizing data with faithful temporal, cross-instrument, and macro correlations. On the policy side, to learn robust policy against market fluctuations, we cast the trading process as a two-player zero-sum Bayesian Markov game, wherein an adversarial agent simulates shifting regimes by perturbing macroeconomic indicators in the macro-conditioned generator, while the trading agent-guided by a quantile belief network-maintains and updates its belief over hidden market states. The trading agent seeks a Robust Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium via Bayesian neural fictitious self-play, stabilizing learning under adversarial market perturbations. Extensive experiments on 9 financial instruments demonstrate that our framework outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines. In extreme events like the COVID, our method shows improved profitability and risk management, offering a reliable solution for trading under uncertain and shifting market dynamics."}

These mappings have been found to support efficient communication; however, this theory does not account for systematic relations within word forms. We examine how a restricted set of grammatical meanings (e.g. person, number) are expressed on verbs and pronouns across typologically diverse languages. Consistent with prior work, we find that verb and pronoun forms are shaped by competing communicative pressures for simplicity (minimizing the inventory of grammatical distinctions) and accuracy (enabling recovery of intended meanings). Crucially, our proposed model uses a novel measure of complexity (inverse of simplicity) based on the learnability of meaning-to-form mappings. This innovation captures fine-grained regularities in linguistic form, allowing better discrimination between attested and unattested systems, and establishes a new connection from efficient communication theory to systematicity in natural language."}

The core innovation is a robust ground-plane homography estimation that links fixed traffic camera views to satellite orthoimagery. This process rectifies the camera's oblique perspective, ensuring that pixel distances accurately represent real-world distances. This enables the acquisition of features such as vehicle trajectory, speed, deceleration, and braking severity without the need for camera calibration. The pipeline employs the MAGSAC++ estimator to build the homography, converting YOLO11 object detections into a rectified top-down coordinate system. All detection and trajectory data are stored in a ClickHouse database for subsequent analysis. A real-world case study at two signalized intersections in Key West, Florida, showcased the system's capabilities. Across two days of daytime footage, braking activity at the higher-volume intersection peaked around 4 PM at approximately 57.5 events per hour, while the second intersection peaked around 10 AM at roughly 15.5 events per hour. The spatial analysis revealed that most braking events initiated upstream, with mild and moderate braking mostly occurring 30 to 45+ meters away from the stop bar and severe braking distributed throughout, but particularly concentrated in lanes with higher interaction and merging activity. The findings highlight the significant potential of this centralized safety information system to support connected vehicles, facilitating proactive traffic management, crash mitigation, and data-driven roadway design and safety analysis."}

This approach implicitly assumes uniform contribution across all embedding coordinates and overlooks the possibility that optimal structural information may be concentrated in specific regions of the embedding space. This study reframes embeddings as searchable landscapes and adapts Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis (DynEGA) to systematically traverse embedding coordinates, treating the dimension index as a pseudo-temporal ordering analogous to intensive longitudinal trajectories. A large-scale Monte Carlo simulation embedded items representing five dimensions of grandiose narcissism using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model, generating network estimations across systematically varied item pool sizes (3-40 items per dimension) and embedding depths (3-1,298 dimensions). Results reveal that Total Entropy Fit Index (TEFI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) leads to competing optimization trajectories across the embedding landscape. TEFI achieves minima at deep embedding ranges (900--1,200 dimensions) where entropy-based organization is maximal but structural accuracy degrades, whereas NMI peaks at shallow depths where dimensional recovery is strongest but entropy-based fit remains suboptimal. Single-metric optimization produces structurally incoherent solutions, whereas a weighted composite criterion identifies embedding dimensions depth regions that jointly balance accuracy and organization. Optimal embedding depth scales systematically with item pool size. These findings establish embedding landscapes as non-uniform semantic spaces requiring principled optimization rather than default full-vector usage."}

We formalize AGI axiomatically as a distributional, resource-bounded semantic predicate, indexed by a task family, a task distribution, a performance functional, and explicit resource budgets. Under this framework, we derive four classes of results. First, we show that generality is inherently relational: there is no distribution-independent notion of AGI. Second, we prove non-invariance results demonstrating that arbitrarily small perturbations of the task distribution can invalidate AGI properties via cliff sets, precluding universal robustness. Third, we establish bounded transfer guarantees, ruling out unbounded generalization across task families under finite resources. Fourth, invoking Rice-style and Gödel--Tarski arguments, we prove that AGI is a nontrivial semantic property and therefore cannot be soundly and completely certified by any computable procedure, including procedures implemented by the agent itself. Consequently, recursive self-improvement schemes that rely on internal self-certification of AGI are ill-posed. Taken together, our results show that strong, distribution-independent claims of AGI are not false but undefined without explicit formal indexing, and that empirical progress in AI does not imply the attainability of self-certifying general intelligence."}

However, figurative language, such as sarcasm, humor, and metaphor, remains a significant challenge, as it conveys intent and emotion through subtle incongruities between expressed and intended meanings. In multimodal settings, accompanying images can amplify or invert textual meaning, demanding models that reason across modalities and account for subjectivity. We propose a three-step framework for developing efficient multimodal reasoning models that can (i) interpret multimodal figurative language, (ii) provide transparent reasoning traces, and (iii) generalize across multiple figurative styles. Experiments across four styles show that (1) incorporating reasoning traces substantially improves multimodal figurative understanding, (2) reasoning learned in one style can transfer to others, especially between related styles like sarcasm and humor, and (3) training jointly across styles yields a generalized reasoning VLM that outperforms much larger open- and closed-source models. Our findings show that lightweight VLMs with verifiable reasoning achieve robust cross-style generalization while providing inspectable reasoning traces for multimodal tasks.

Although these models are extremely large, their sparse activation enables inference to be performed by accessing only a fraction of the model at a time. This property opens the possibility of on-device inference of MoE, which was previously considered infeasible for such large models. Consequently, various systems have been proposed to leverage this sparsity and enable efficient MoE inference for edge devices. However, previous MoE inference systems like Fiddler[8] or DAOP[13] rely on DRAM-based offloading and are not suitable for memory constrained on-device environments. As recent MoE models grow to hundreds of gigabytes, RAM-offloading solutions become impractical. To address this, we propose FlashMoE, a system that offloads inactive experts to SSD, enabling efficient MoE inference under limited RAM. FlashMoE incorporates a lightweight ML-based caching strategy that adaptively combines recency and frequency signals to maximize expert reuse, significantly reducing storage I/O. In addition, we built a user-grade desktop platform to demonstrate the practicality of FlashMoE. On this real hardware setup, FlashMoE improves cache hit rate by up to 51% over well-known offloading policies such as LRU and LFU, and achieves up to 2.6x speedup compared to existing MoE inference systems."}

However, we find that existing specificity evaluation protocols are inadequate for this purpose. We systematically elaborated on the three fundamental issues it faces. Beyond the conceptual issues, we further empirically demonstrate that existing specificity metrics are weakly correlated with the strength of specificity regularizers. We also find that current metrics lack sufficient sensitivity, rendering them ineffective at distinguishing the specificity performance of different methods. Finally, we propose a constructive evaluation protocol. Under this protocol, the conflict between open-ended LLMs and the assumption of determined answers is eliminated, query-independent fluency biases are avoided, and the evaluation strictness can be smoothly adjusted within a near-continuous space. Experiments across various LLMs, datasets, and editing methods show that metrics derived from the proposed protocol are more sensitive to changes in the strength of specificity regularizers and exhibit strong correlation with them, enabling more fine-grained discrimination of different methods' knowledge preservation capabilities."}

The system was produced through 107 prompts: 21 feature requests, 72 bug fix prompts, 9 prompts sharing information from Ring documentation, 4 prompts providing architectural guidance, and 1 prompt dedicated to generating documentation. Development progressed across five phases, with the Window Manager phase requiring the most interaction, followed by complex UI systems and controls expansion. Bug related prompts covered redraw issues, event handling faults, runtime errors, and layout inconsistencies, while feature requests focused primarily on new widgets, window manager capabilities, and advanced UI components. Most prompts were short, reflecting a highly iterative workflow in which the human role was limited to specifying requirements, validating behaviour, and issuing corrective prompts without writing any code manually. The resulting framework includes a complete windowing subsystem, event driven architecture, interactive widgets, hierarchical menus, grid and tree components, tab controls, and a multi window desktop environment.

DF-RAG builds upon the Maximal Marginal Relevance framework to select information chunks that are both relevant to the query and maximally dissimilar from each other. A key innovation of DF-RAG is its ability to optimize the level of diversity for each query dynamically at test time without requiring any additional fine-tuning or prior information. We show that DF-RAG improves F1 performance on reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks by 4-10 percent over vanilla RAG using cosine similarity and also outperforms other established baselines. Furthermore, we estimate an Oracle ceiling of up to 18 percent absolute F1 gains over vanilla RAG, of which DF-RAG captures up to 91.3 percent."}

However, their ability to improve existing programming answers in a human-like manner remains underexplored. On technical question-and-answer platforms such as Stack Overflow (SO), contributors often revise answers based on user comments that identify errors, inefficiencies, or missing explanations. Yet roughly one-third of this feedback is never addressed due to limited time, expertise, or visibility, leaving many answers incomplete or outdated. This study investigates whether LLMs can enhance programming answers by interpreting and incorporating comment-based feedback. We make four main contributions. First, we introduce ReSOlve, a benchmark consisting of 790 SO answers with associated comment threads, annotated for improvement-related and general feedback. Second, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to identify actionable concerns, finding that DeepSeek achieves the best balance between precision and recall. Third, we present AUTOCOMBAT, an LLM-powered tool that improves programming answers by jointly leveraging user comments and question context. Compared to human revised references, AUTOCOMBAT produces near-human quality improvements while preserving the original intent and significantly outperforming the baseline. Finally, a user study with 58 practitioners shows strong practical value, with 84.5 percent indicating they would adopt or recommend the tool. Overall, AUTOCOMBAT demonstrates the potential of scalable, feedback-driven answer refinement to improve the reliability and trustworthiness of technical knowledge platforms."}

Moreover, in practical scenarios such as adding/dropping teammates or facing environment dynamics that differ from the training, CTDE methods can be brittle and costly to retrain, whereas distributed approaches allow agents to adapt using only local information and peer-to-peer communication. We present a distributed MARL framework that removes the need for centralized critics or global information. Firstly, we develop a novel Distributed Graph Attention Network (D-GAT) that performs global state inference through multi-hop communication, where agents integrate neighbor features via input-dependent attention weights in a fully distributed manner. Leveraging D-GAT, we develop the distributed graph-attention MAPPO (DG-MAPPO) -- a distributed MARL framework where agents optimize local policies and value functions using local observations, multi-hop communication, and shared/averaged rewards. Empirical evaluation on the StarCraftII Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, and Multi-Agent Mujoco demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines, achieving superior coordination across a wide range of cooperative tasks with both homogeneous and heterogeneous teams. Our distributed MARL framework provides a principled and scalable solution for robust collaboration, eliminating the need for centralized training or global observability. To the best of our knowledge, DG-MAPPO appears to be the first to fully eliminate reliance on privileged centralized information, enabling agents to learn and act solely through peer-to-peer communication."}

To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a benchmark based on paired Neutral Prompts (NP) and Disability-Contextualised Prompts (DP) and evaluate 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs under a zero-shot setting across 9 disability categories. Our evaluation framework treats interpretive fidelity as core objective and combines standard text-based metrics capturing affective degradation through shifts in sentiment, social regard and response length with an LLM-as-judge protocol, validated by annotators with lived experience of disability. We find that introducing disability context consistently degrades interpretive fidelity, inducing interpretation shifts characterised by speculative inference, narrative elaboration, affective degradation and deficit oriented framing. These effects are further amplified along race and gender dimension.

To address this gap, we introduce Verifiable Process Reward Models (VPRMs), a reinforcement-learning framework in which intermediate reasoning steps are checked by deterministic, rule-based verifiers. We apply VPRMs to risk-of-bias assessment for medical evidence synthesis, a domain where guideline-defined criteria and rule-based decision paths enable programmatic verification of reasoning traces. Across multiple datasets, we find that VPRMs generate reasoning that adheres closely to domain rules and achieve substantially higher coherence between step-level decisions and final labels. Results show that VPRMs achieve up to 20% higher F1 than state-of-the-art models and 6.5% higher than verifiable outcome rewards, with substantial gains in evidence grounding and logical coherence."}

We analyze 33,596 agent-generated PRs (APRs) and 6,618 human PRs (HPRs) to compare code-change characteristics and message quality. We observe that APR-introduced symbols (functions and classes) are removed much sooner than those in HPRs (median time to removal 3 vs. 34 days) and are also removed more often (symbol churn 7.33% vs. 4.10%), reflecting a focus on other tasks like documentation and test updates. Agents generate stronger commit-level messages (semantic similarity 0.72 vs. 0.68) but lag humans at PR-level summarization (PR-commit similarity 0.86 vs. 0.88). Commit message length is the best predictor of description quality, indicating reliance on individual commits over full-PR reasoning.

To address these issues, we propose the Cross-Modal Joint-Individual Variational Network (CM-JIVNet), a unified probabilistic framework designed to learn factorized latent representations from paired SC-FC datasets. Our model utilizes a multi-head attention fusion module to capture non-linear cross-modal dependencies while isolating independent, modality-specific signals. Validated on Human Connectome Project Young Adult (HCP-YA) data, CM-JIVNet demonstrates superior performance in cross-modal reconstruction and behavioral trait prediction.

Through extensive experiments of testing SOTA LLMs on a new syllogism dataset, we have some interesting findings: (i) Model size scaling promotes the shift toward modern logic; (ii) Thinking serves as an efficient accelerator beyond parameter scaling; (iii) the Base model plays a crucial role in determining how easily and stably this shift can emerge.

However, existing automated approaches remain insufficient. Traditional static analysis methods struggle to precisely capture contextual dependencies, especially when vulnerabilities span multiple functions or modules. Large language models (LLMs) often lack the ability to retrieve and exploit sufficient contextual information, resulting in incomplete reasoning and unreliable outcomes. Meanwhile, recurring vulnerabilities emerge repeatedly due to code reuse and shared logic, making historical vulnerability knowledge an indispensable foundation for effective vulnerability detection and repair. Nevertheless, prior approaches such as clone-based detection and patch porting, have not fully leveraged this knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MAVM, a multi-agent framework for end-to-end recurring vulnerability management. MAVM integrates five components, including a vulnerability knowledge base, detection, confirmation, repair, and validation, into a unified multi-agent pipeline. We construct a knowledge base from publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, thereby addressing the underuse of historical knowledge in prior work and mitigating the lack of domain-specific expertise in LLMs. Furthermore, we design context-retrieval tools that allow agents to extract and reason over repository-level information, overcoming the contextual limitations of previous methods. Based on agents, MAVM effectively simulates real-world security workflows. To evaluate the performance of MAVM, we construct a dataset containing 78 real-world patch-porting cases (covering 114 function-level migrations). On this dataset, MAVM successfully detects and repairs 51 real vulnerabilities, outperforming baselines by 31.9%-45.2% in repair accuracy, which demonstrates its effectiveness."}

To systematically address this gap, we formally introduce a novel task, termed \\emph{incomplete multi-view multi-label class incremental learning} (IMvMLCIL), which requires models to simultaneously address heterogeneous missing views and dynamic class expansion. To tackle this task, we propose \\textsf{E2PL}, an Effective and Efficient Prompt Learning framework for IMvMLCIL. \\textsf{E2PL} unifies two novel prompt designs: \\emph{task-tailored prompts} for class-incremental adaptation and \\emph{missing-aware prompts} for the flexible integration of arbitrary view-missing scenarios. To fundamentally address the exponential parameter explosion inherent in missing-aware prompts, we devise an \\emph{efficient prototype tensorization} module, which leverages atomic tensor decomposition to elegantly reduce the prompt parameter complexity from exponential to linear w.r.t. the number of views.

We further propose a counterfactual upper-bound analysis to quantify the contribution of each localization stage to repair success. We evaluate our approach on Python and Java projects from SWE-bench Verified, Lite, and Java. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including Agentless and OpenHands, our method consistently improves localization accuracy. On SWE-bench Verified, file-level Hit@1 improves from 71.4% to 85%, and MRR from 81.8% to 88.8%. At the element level, Exact Match under top-3 files increases from 36% to 69%. Integrating our localization into Agentless yields a 12.8% end-to-end repair success improvement."}

It applies convolution with randomly generated kernels on a time series, producing features that can be used to train a linear classifier or regressor like Ridge. At the time of publication, ROCKET was on par with the best state-of-the-art algorithms for TSC in terms of accuracy while being significantly less computationally expensive, making ROCKET a compelling algorithm for TSC. This also led to several subsequent versions, further improving accuracy and computational efficiency. The currently available ROCKET implementations are mostly bound to execution on CPU. However, convolution is a task that can be highly parallelized and is therefore suited to be executed on GPU, which speeds up the computation significantly. A key difficulty arises from the inhomogeneous kernels ROCKET uses, making standard methods for applying convolution on GPU inefficient. In this work, we propose an algorithm that is able to efficiently perform ROCKET on GPU and achieves up to 11 times higher computational efficiency per watt than ROCKET on CPU.

The standard trial-and-error approach to find feasible parameter configurations is highly inefficient because validating each configuration is expensive in terms of resources (physical and human labor) and the configuration space is very large. This paper combines the general principles of AI-driven adaptive experimental design with domain knowledge to address the challenging problem of discovering feasible configurations. The key idea is to build a surrogate model from past experiments to intelligently select a small batch of input configurations for validation in each iteration. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, we deploy it for Directed Energy Deposition process to print GRCop--42, a high-performance copper--chromium--niobium alloy developed by NASA for aerospace applications. Within three months, our approach yielded multiple defect-free outputs across a range of laser powers dramatically reducing time to result and resource expenditure compared to several months of manual experimentation by domain scientists with no success. By enabling high-quality GRCop--42 fabrication on readily available infrared laser platforms for the first time, we democratize access to this critical alloy, paving the way for cost-effective, decentralized production for aerospace applications."}

In this paper, we formalize this challenge by linking input ambiguity to aleatoric uncertainty (AU), which is the irreducible uncertainty arising from underspecified input. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct CV-MedBench, the first benchmark designed for studying input ambiguity in Medical QA. Using this benchmark, we analyze AU from a representation engineering perspective, revealing that AU is linearly encoded in LLM's internal activation patterns. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel AU-guided \"Clarify-Before-Answer\" framework, which incorporates AU-Probe - a lightweight module that detects input ambiguity directly from hidden states. Unlike existing uncertainty estimation methods, AU-Probe requires neither LLM fine-tuning nor multiple forward passes, enabling an efficient mechanism to proactively request user clarification and significantly enhance safety. Extensive experiments across four open LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our QA framework, with an average accuracy improvement of 9.48% over baselines. Our framework provides an efficient and robust solution for safe Medical QA, strengthening the reliability of health-related applications.

We propose the Triangle of Similarity, a framework that combines three complementary perspectives: static representational similarity (CKA/Procrustes), functional similarity (Linear Mode Connectivity or Predictive Similarity), and sparsity similarity (robustness under pruning). Analyzing a range of CNNs, Vision Transformers, and Vision-Language Models using both in-distribution (ImageNetV2) and out-of-distribution (CIFAR-10) testbeds, our initial findings suggest that: (1) architectural family is a primary determinant of representational similarity, forming distinct clusters; (2) CKA self-similarity and task accuracy are strongly correlated during pruning, though accuracy often degrades more sharply; and (3) for some model pairs, pruning appears to regularize representations, exposing a shared computational core. This framework offers a more holistic approach for assessing whether models have converged on similar internal mechanisms, providing a useful tool for model selection and analysis in scientific research."}

Adoption of Coding Agents on GitHub", "comment": null, "summary": "In the first half of 2025, coding agents have emerged as a category of development tools that have very quickly transitioned to the practice. Unlike ''traditional'' code completion LLMs such as Copilot, agents like Cursor, Claude Code, or Codex operate with high degrees of autonomy, up to generating complete pull requests starting from a developer-provided task description. This new mode of operation is poised to change the landscape in an even larger way than code completion LLMs did, making the need to study their impact critical. Also, unlike traditional LLMs, coding agents tend to leave more explicit traces in software engineering artifacts, such as co-authoring commits or pull requests. We leverage these traces to present the first large-scale study (129,134 projects) of the adoption of coding agents on GitHub, finding an estimated adoption rate of 15.85%--22.60%, which is very high for a technology only a few months old--and increasing. We carry out an in-depth study of the adopters we identified, finding that adoption is broad: it spans the entire spectrum of project maturity; it includes established organizations; and it concerns diverse programming languages or project topics. At the commit level, we find that commits assisted by coding agents are larger than commits only authored by human developers, and have a large proportion of features and bug fixes.

We propose an architectural principle, the mouth is not the brain, that explicitly separates world models from language models. Our architecture comprises three components: a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) that captures domain structure as an energy-based world model, an adapter that projects latent belief states into embedding space, and a frozen GPT-2 that provides linguistic competence without domain knowledge. We instantiate this framework in the consumer review domain using Amazon smartphone reviews. Experiments demonstrate that (1) conditioning through the world model yields significantly higher sentiment correlation, lower perplexity, and greater semantic similarity compared to prompt-based generation alone; (2) the DBM's energy function distinguishes coherent from incoherent market configurations, assigning higher energy to implausible brand-price combinations; and (3) interventions on specific attributes propagate causally to generated text with intervened outputs exhibiting distributions statistically consistent with naturally occurring samples sharing the target configuration. These findings suggest that even small-scale language models can achieve consistent, controllable generation when connected to an appropriate world model, providing empirical support for separating linguistic competence from world understanding."}

Comprising 31,920 benign boundary prompts across seven health categories (e.g., self-harm, medical misinformation), our framework uses an automated pipeline with human validation to test models at varying levels of intent ambiguity.

In particular, an LLM agent may pursue objectives that deviate from human values and ethical norms, a risk known as value misalignment. Existing evaluations primarily focus on responses to explicit harmful input or robustness against system failure, while value misalignment in realistic, fully benign, and agentic settings remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we first formalize the Loss-of-Control risk and identify the previously underexamined Intrinsic Value Misalignment (Intrinsic VM). We then introduce IMPRESS (Intrinsic Value Misalignment Probes in REalistic Scenario Set), a scenario-driven framework for systematically assessing this risk. Following our framework, we construct benchmarks composed of realistic, fully benign, and contextualized scenarios, using a multi-stage LLM generation pipeline with rigorous quality control. We evaluate Intrinsic VM on 21 state-of-the-art LLM agents and find that it is a common and broadly observed safety risk across models. Moreover, the misalignment rates vary by motives, risk types, model scales, and architectures. While decoding strategies and hyperparameters exhibit only marginal influence, contextualization and framing mechanisms significantly shape misalignment behaviors. Finally, we conduct human verification to validate our automated judgments and assess existing mitigation strategies, such as safety prompting and guardrails, which show instability or limited effectiveness. We further demonstrate key use cases of IMPRESS across the AI Ecosystem. Our code and benchmark will be publicly released upon acceptance."}

However, this metric is inherently retrospective, reflecting only the past 90 days of activity and providing no insight into future maintenance, which limits its usefulness for proactive risk assessment. In this paper, we study to what extent future maintenance activity, as captured by the OpenSSF Maintained score, can be forecasted. We analyze 3,220 GitHub repositories associated with the top 1% most central PyPI libraries by PageRank and reconstruct historical Maintained scores over a three-year period. We formulate the task as multivariate time series forecasting and consider four target representations: raw scores, bucketed maintenance levels, numerical trend slopes, and categorical trend types. We compare a statistical model (VARMA), a machine learning model (Random Forest), and a deep learning model (LSTM) across training windows of 3-12 months and forecasting horizons of 1-6 months. Our results show that future maintenance activity can be predicted with meaningful accuracy, particularly for aggregated representations such as bucketed scores and trend types, achieving accuracies above 0.95 and 0.80, respectively. Simpler statistical and machine learning models perform on par with deep learning approaches, indicating that complex architectures are not required. These findings suggest that predictive modeling can effectively complement existing Scorecard metrics, enabling more proactive assessment of open-source maintenance risks."}

Unlike differentiable mechanism design, which optimizes mechanisms forward, we infer mechanisms from behavior in an observational setting. We propose DIML, a likelihood-based framework that differentiates through a model of multi-agent learning dynamics and uses the candidate mechanism to generate counterfactual payoffs needed to predict observed actions. We establish identifiability of payoff differences under a conditional logit response model and prove statistical consistency of maximum likelihood estimation under standard regularity conditions. We evaluate DIML with simulated interactions of learning agents across unstructured neural mechanisms, congestion tolling, public goods subsidies, and large-scale anonymous games. DIML reliably recovers identifiable incentive differences and supports counterfactual prediction, where its performance rivals tabular enumeration oracle in small environments and its convergence scales to large, hundred-participant environments.

Despite this, we observe that even well-trained MoE models exhibit significantly imbalanced routing. This behavior is arguably natural-and even desirable - as imbalanced routing allows models to concentrate domain-specific knowledge within a subset of experts. Expert parallelism (EP) is designed to scale MoE models by distributing experts across multiple devices, but with a less-discussed assumption of balanced routing. Under extreme imbalance, EP can funnel a disproportionate number of tokens to a small number of experts, leading to compute- and memory-bound failures on overloaded devices during post-training or inference, where explicit load balancing is often inapplicable. We propose Least-Loaded Expert Parallelism (LLEP), a novel EP algorithm that dynamically reroutes excess tokens and associated expert parameters from overloaded devices to underutilized ones. This ensures that all devices complete their workloads within the minimum collective latency while respecting memory constraints. Across different model scales, LLEP achieves up to 5x speedup and 4x reduction in peak memory usage compared to standard EP. This enables faster and higher-throughput post-training and inference, with ~1.9x faster for gpt-oss-120b. We support our method with extensive theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations, including ablation studies.

We argue this gap stems largely from the prevailing single-pass paradigm, which lacks the iterative reasoning, schema exploration, and error-correction behaviors that humans naturally employ. To address this limitation, we introduce SQL-Trail, a multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) agentic framework for Text-to-SQL. Rather than producing a query in one shot, SQL-Trail interacts with the database environment and uses execution feedback to iteratively refine its predictions. Our approach centers on two key ideas: (i) an adaptive turn-budget allocation mechanism that scales the agent's interaction depth to match question difficulty, and (ii) a composite reward panel that jointly incentivizes SQL correctness and efficient exploration. Across benchmarks, SQL-Trail sets a new state of the art and delivers strong data efficiency--up to 18x higher than prior single-pass RL state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our 7B and 14B models outperform substantially larger proprietary systems by 5% on average, underscoring the effectiveness of interactive, agentic workflows for robust Text-to-SQL generation."}

A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development. To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale. Central to our approach is **agent-native data**-supervision comprising two complementary types of trajectories: **contextually-native trajectories** that preserve the complete information flow an agent experiences, offering broad coverage and diversity; and **environmentally-native trajectories** collected from executable repositories where observations stem from actual tool invocations and test executions, providing depth and interaction authenticity. We verify the model's agentic capabilities on `SWE-Bench Verified`. We demonstrate our superiority over the previous open software engineering mid-training recipe `Kimi-Dev` under two post-training settings with an aligned base model and agentic scaffold, while using less than half mid-training tokens (73.1B).

By transforming data from a scarce resource into a controllable asset, LLMs mitigate the bottlenecks imposed by the acquisition costs of real-world data for model training, evaluation, and system iteration. However, ensuring the high quality of LLM-generated synthetic data remains a critical challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on generation methodologies, with limited direct attention to the quality of the resulting data. Furthermore, most studies are restricted to single modalities, lacking a unified perspective across different data types. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{LLM Data Auditor framework}. In this framework, we first describe how LLMs are utilized to generate data across six distinct modalities. More importantly, we systematically categorize intrinsic metrics for evaluating synthetic data from two dimensions: quality and trustworthiness. This approach shifts the focus from extrinsic evaluation, which relies on downstream task performance, to the inherent properties of the data itself. Using this evaluation system, we analyze the experimental evaluations of representative generation methods for each modality and identify substantial deficiencies in current evaluation practices. Based on these findings, we offer concrete recommendations for the community to improve the evaluation of data generation. Finally, the framework outlines methodologies for the practical application of synthetic data across different modalities."}

While hybrid attention strategies that combine sparse and full attention within a single model offer a viable solution, they typically employ static computation ratios (i.e., fixed proportions of sparse versus full attention) and fail to adapt to the varying sparsity sensitivities of downstream tasks during inference. To address this issue, we propose Elastic Attention, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its overall sparsity based on the input. This is achieved by integrating a lightweight Attention Router into the existing pretrained model, which dynamically assigns each attention head to different computation modes. Within only 12 hours of training on 8xA800 GPUs, our method enables models to achieve both strong performance and efficient inference. Experiments across three long-context benchmarks on widely-used LLMs demonstrate the superiority of our method."}

In this literature, computational experiments are the main means of evaluation, and the credibility of results depends on experimental design and reporting. Objective: This paper audits recent software defect prediction (SDP) studies by assessing their experimental design, analysis, and reporting practices against accepted norms from statistics, machine learning, and empirical software engineering. The aim is to characterise current practice and assess the reproducibility of published results. Method: We audited SDP studies indexed in SCOPUS between 2019 and 2023, focusing on design and analysis choices such as outcome measures, out of sample validation strategies, and the use of statistical inference. Nine study issues were evaluated. Reproducibility was assessed using the instrument proposed by González Barahona and Robles. Results: The search identified approximately 1,585 SDP experiments published during the period. From these, we randomly sampled 101 papers, including 61 journal and 40 conference publications, with almost 50 percent behind paywalls. We observed substantial variation in research practice. The number of datasets ranged from 1 to 365, learners or learner variants from 1 to 34, and performance measures from 1 to 9. About 45 percent of studies applied formal statistical inference. Across the sample, we identified 427 issues, with a median of four per paper, and only one paper without issues. Reproducibility ranged from near complete to severely limited. We also identified two cases of tortured phrases and possible paper mill activity. Conclusions: Experimental design and reporting practices vary widely, and almost half of the studies provide insufficient detail to support reproduction. The audit indicates substantial scope for improvement."}

However, their use in sensitive applications has raised concerns about the potential leakage of training data. Research on privacy leakage in GNNs has largely been shaped by findings from non-graph domains, such as images and tabular data. We emphasize the need of graph specific analysis and investigate the impact of graph structure on node level membership inference. We formalize MI over node-neighbourhood tuples and investigate two important dimensions: (i) training graph construction and (ii) inference-time edge access. Empirically, snowball's coverage bias often harms generalisation relative to random sampling, while enabling inter-train-test edges at inference improves test accuracy, shrinks the train-test gap, and yields the lowest membership advantage across most of the models and datasets. We further show that the generalisation gap empirically measured as the performance difference between the train and test nodes is an incomplete proxy for MI risk: access to edges dominates-MI can rise or fall independent of gap changes. Finally, we examine the auditability of differentially private GNNs, adapting the definition of statistical exchangeability of train-test data points for graph based models. We show that for node level tasks the inductive splits (random or snowball sampled) break exchangeability, limiting the applicability of standard bounds for membership advantage of differential private models."}

However, existing benchmarks predominantly target consumer-oriented scenarios (e.g., e-commerce and travel booking), failing to capture the complexity and rigor of professional enterprise workflows. Enterprise systems pose distinct challenges, including high-density user interfaces, strict business logic constraints, and a strong reliance on precise, state-consistent information retrieval-settings in which current generalist agents often struggle. To address this gap, we introduce EntWorld, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 1,756 tasks across six representative enterprise domains, including customer relationship management (CRM), information technology infrastructure library (ITIL), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Unlike previous datasets that depend on fragile execution traces or extensive manual annotation, EntWorld adopts a schema-grounded task generation framework that directly reverse-engineers business logic from underlying database schemas, enabling the synthesis of realistic, long-horizon workflows. Moreover, we propose a SQL-based deterministic verification mechanism in building datasets that replaces ambiguous visual matching with rigorous state-transition validation. Experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4.1) achieve 47.61% success rate on EntWorld, substantially lower than the human performance, highlighting a pronounced enterprise gap in current agentic capabilities and the necessity of developing domain-specific agents. We release EntWorld as a rigorous testbed to facilitate the development and evaluation of the next generation of enterprise-ready digital agents."}

The use of language models to reduce the human cost of peer review has been actively explored as a potential solution to this challenge. A method has been proposed to evaluate the level of substantiation in scientific reviews in a manner that is interpretable by humans. This method extracts the core components of an argument, claims and evidence, and assesses the level of substantiation based on the proportion of claims supported by evidence. The level of substantiation refers to the extent to which claims are based on objective facts. However, when assessing the level of substantiation, simply detecting the presence or absence of supporting evidence for a claim is insufficient; it is also necessary to accurately assess the logical inference between a claim and its evidence. We propose a new evaluation metric for scientific review comments that assesses the logical inference between claims and evidence. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a higher correlation with human scores than conventional methods, indicating its potential to better support the efficiency of the peer-review process."}

Code available at: https://github.com/FujitsuResearch/knexa-fl", "summary": "Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized domains is constrained by a fundamental challenge: the need for diverse, cross-organizational data conflicts with the principles of data privacy and sovereignty. While Federated Learning (FL) provides a framework for collaboration without raw data exchange, its classic centralized form introduces a single point of failure and remains vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Decentralized FL (DFL) mitigates this risk by removing the central aggregator but typically relies on inefficient, random peer-to-peer (P2P) pairings, forming a collaboration graph that is blind to agent heterogeneity and risks negative transfer. This paper introduces KNEXA-FL, a novel framework for orchestrated decentralization that resolves this trade-off. KNEXA-FL employs a non-aggregating Central Profiler/Matchmaker (CPM) that formulates P2P collaboration as a contextual bandit problem, using a LinUCB algorithm on abstract agent profiles to learn an optimal matchmaking policy. It orchestrates direct knowledge exchange between heterogeneous, PEFT-based LLM agents via secure distillation, without ever accessing the models themselves. Our comprehensive experiments on a challenging code generation task show that KNEXA-FL yields substantial gains, improving Pass@1 by approx. 50% relative to random P2P collaboration. Critically, our orchestrated approach demonstrates stable convergence, in stark contrast to a powerful centralized distillation baseline which suffers from catastrophic performance collapse. Our work establishes adaptive, learning-based orchestration as a foundational principle for building robust and effective decentralized AI ecosystems."}

However, generating such features is challenging: it requires reasoning over complex schemas and exploring a combinatorially large feature space, all without explicit supervision. To address these challenges, we propose ReFuGe, an agentic framework that leverages specialized large language model agents: (1) a schema selection agent identifies the tables and columns relevant to the task, (2) a feature generation agent produces diverse candidate features from the selected schema, and (3) a feature filtering agent evaluates and retains promising features through reasoning-based and validation-based filtering. It operates within an iterative feedback loop until performance converges. Experiments on RDB benchmarks demonstrate that ReFuGe substantially improves performance on various RDB prediction tasks.

We identify language- and modality-selective neurons using average-precision ranking, investigate their functional role via median-replacement interventions at inference time, and analyze activation-magnitude inequality across languages and modalities. Across experiments, we find evidence of incomplete modality invariance. Although encoder representations become increasingly language-agnostic, this compression makes it more difficult for the shared decoder to recover the language of origin when constructing modality-agnostic representations, particularly when adapting from speech to text. We further observe sharply localized modality-selective structure in cross-attention key and value projections. Finally, speech-conditioned decoding and non-dominant scripts exhibit higher activation concentration, indicating heavier reliance on a small subset of neurons, which may underlie increased brittleness across modalities and languages."}

Specifically, we analyze their usage by dependent projects on GitHub, examining how they invoke the frameworks' APIs and commands. Then, we qualitatively analyze feature requests and enhancements mined from the frameworks' issue trackers, relating these desired improvements to the previously identified usage features. Results indicate that MLOps frameworks are rarely used out-of-the-box and are infrequently integrated into GitHub Workflows, but rather, developers use their APIs to implement custom functionality in their projects. Used features concern core ML phases and whole infrastructure governance, sometimes leveraging multiple frameworks with complementary features. The mapping with feature requests highlights that users mainly ask for enhancements to core features of the frameworks, but also better API exposure and CI/CD integration."}

Unlike language-conditioned approaches that require semantic input at deployment, ConceptACT uses human-provided concepts (object properties, spatial relationships, task constraints) exclusively during demonstration collection, adding minimal annotation burden. We integrate concepts using a modified transformer architecture in which the final encoder layer implements concept-aware cross-attention, supervised to align with human annotations. Through experiments on two robotic manipulation tasks with logical constraints, we demonstrate that ConceptACT converges faster and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard ACT. Crucially, we show that architectural integration through attention mechanisms significantly outperforms naive auxiliary prediction losses or language-conditioned models. These results demonstrate that properly integrated semantic supervision provides powerful inductive biases for more efficient robot learning."}

Faramesh canonicalizes agent intent into a Canonical Action Representation (CAR), evaluates actions deterministically against policy and state, and issues a decision artifact (PERMIT/DEFER/DENY) that executors must validate prior to execution. The system is designed to be framework- and model-agnostic, supports multi-agent and multi-tenant deployments, and remains independent of transport protocols (e.g., MCP). Faramesh further provides decision-centric, append-only provenance logging keyed by canonical action hashes, enabling auditability, verification, and deterministic replay without re-running agent reasoning.

This approach introduces translation artifacts and neglects culturally specific entities native to the target language, failing to reflect the true knowledge distribution of LLMs. To address this, we propose CLM-Bench, a culture-aware benchmark constructed using a native Chinese-first methodology. We curate 1,010 high-quality CounterFact pairs rooted in Chinese cultural contexts and align them with English counterparts. Using CLM-Bench, we conduct extensive experiments on representative LLMs (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen2) and reveal a significant Cross-lingual Misalignment: edits in one language function independently and fail to propagate to the other. We further provide a geometric explanation via layer-wise representation analysis, demonstrating that edit vectors for Chinese and English are nearly orthogonal -- residing in disjoint subspaces -- while mixed-lingual editing exhibits linear additivity of these vectors. Our findings challenge the effectiveness of current methods in cross-lingual transfer and underscore the importance of culturally native benchmarks."}

Through an analysis of numerical uncertainty of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we observe that many operations are applied to values dominated by numerical noise and have negligible influence on model outputs. In some models, up to two-thirds of convolution operations appear redundant. We introduce Conservative & Aggressive NaNs, two novel variants of max pooling and unpooling that identify numerically unstable voxels and replace them with NaNs, allowing subsequent layers to skip computations on irrelevant data. Both methods are implemented within PyTorch and require no architectural changes. We evaluate these approaches on four CNN models spanning neuroimaging and image classification tasks. For inputs containing at least 50% NaNs, we observe consistent runtime improvements; for data with more than two-thirds NaNs )common in several neuroimaging settings) we achieve an average inference speedup of 1.67x. Conservative NaNs reduces convolution operations by an average of 30% across models and datasets, with no measurable performance degradation, and can skip up to 64.64% of convolutions in specific layers. Aggressive NaNs can skip up to 69.30% of convolutions but may occasionally affect performance.

Federated Learning offers a way out to this problem by facilitating collaborative model training without having the raw patient data centralized. However, clinical datasets intrinsically have non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) features brought about by demographic disparity and diversity in disease prevalence and institutional practices. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation research of Federated Proximal Optimization (FedProx) for Heart Disease prediction based on UCI Heart Disease dataset. We generate realistic non-IID data partitions by simulating four heterogeneous hospital clients from the Cleveland Clinic dataset (303 patients), by inducing statistical heterogeneity by demographic-based stratification. Our experimental results show that FedProx with proximal parameter mu=0.05 achieves 85.00% accuracy, which is better than both centralized learning (83.33%) and isolated local models (78.45% average) without revealing patient privacy. Through generous sheer ablation studies with statistical validation on 50 independent runs we demonstrate that proximal regularization is effective in curbing client drift in heterogeneous environments. This proof-of-concept research offers algorithmic insights and practical deployment guidelines for real-world federated healthcare systems, and thus, our results are directly transferable to hospital IT-administrators, implementing privacy-preserving collaborative learning."}

In LLM-based agentic workflows, such violations can propagate and amplify along reasoning chains, causing task failures and system incidents. This paper presents NSVIF, a neuro-symbolic framework for verifying whether an LLM's output follows the instructions used to prompt the LLM. NSVIF is a universal, general-purpose verifier; it makes no assumption about the instruction or the LLM. NSVIF formulates instruction-following verification as a constraint-satisfaction problem by modeling user instructions as constraints. NSVIF models both logical and semantic constraints; constraint solving is done by a unified solver that orchestrates logical reasoning and semantic analysis. To evaluate NSVIF, we develop VIFBENCH, a new benchmark for instruction-following verifiers with fine-grained data labels. Experiments show that NSVIF significantly outperforms LLM-based approaches and provides interpretable feedback. We also show that feedback from NSVIF helps improve LLMs' instruction-following capability without post-training."}

In this work, we introduce a clustering-based memory compression strategy that balances context efficiency and personalization quality. Our method groups memories by similarity and merges them within clusters prior to concatenation, thereby preserving coherence while reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers the number of memory tokens while outperforming baseline strategies such as naive averaging or direct concatenation.

GraphRAG optimisation enhances query performance across semantic communities that include seismic wave simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and performance tuning libraries. A reverse engineering component derives three-level query strategies for RAG retrieval through static analysis of Fortran source code. To deliver precise contextual information for language model guidance, the multi-stage retrieval pipeline performs parallel searching, concept expansion, community-scale retrieval, and semantic similarity analysis. Code synthesis is governed by Pydantic-based constraints to guarantee structured outputs and reliability. A comprehensive validation framework integrates conventional static analysis with the G-Eval approach, covering execution correctness, structural soundness, mathematical consistency, and API compliance. The overall agent workflow is implemented on the LangGraph framework and adopts concurrent processing to support quality-based iterative refinement and state-aware dynamic routing. The principal contribution lies in the incorporation of feedback mechanisms motivated by reinforcement learning, enabling a transition from static code translation toward dynamic and adaptive analytical behavior."}

In practical deployments, workloads span lightweight OCR to complex multimodal reasoning; using one MLLM for all queries either over-provisions compute on easy instances or sacrifices accuracy on hard ones. Query-level model selection (routing) addresses this tension, but extending routing from text-only LLMs to MLLMs is nontrivial due to modality fusion, wide variation in computational cost across models, and the absence of a standardized, budget-aware evaluation. We present MMR-Bench, a unified benchmark that isolates the multimodal routing problem and enables comparison under fixed candidate sets and cost models. MMR-Bench provides (i) a controlled environment with modality-aware inputs and variable compute budgets, (ii) a broad suite of vision-language tasks covering OCR, general VQA, and multimodal math reasoning, and (iii) strong single-model reference, oracle upper bounds, and representative routing policies. Using MMR-Bench, we show that incorporating multimodal signals improves routing quality. Empirically, these cues improve the cost-accuracy frontier and enable the routed system to exceed the strongest single model's accuracy at roughly 33% of its cost. Furthermore, policies trained on a subset of models and tasks generalize zero-shot to new datasets and text-only benchmarks without retuning, establishing MMR-Bench as a foundation for studying adaptive multimodal model selection and efficient MLLM deployment.

However, existing detection methods struggle with two core limitations: (1) modality fragmentation, which leads to poor generalization across diverse and adversarial deepfake modalities; and (2) shallow inter-modal reasoning, resulting in limited detection of fine-grained semantic inconsistencies. To address these, we propose ConLLM (Contrastive Learning with Large Language Models), a hybrid framework for robust multimodal deepfake detection. ConLLM employs a two-stage architecture: stage 1 uses Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) to extract modality-specific embeddings; stage 2 aligns these embeddings via contrastive learning to mitigate modality fragmentation, and refines them using LLM-based reasoning to address shallow inter-modal reasoning by capturing semantic inconsistencies. ConLLM demonstrates strong performance across audio, video, and audio-visual modalities. It reduces audio deepfake EER by up to 50%, improves video accuracy by up to 8%, and achieves approximately 9% accuracy gains in audio-visual tasks. Ablation studies confirm that PTM-based embeddings contribute 9%-10% consistent improvements across modalities."}

The pipeline runs in approximately three minutes per patient on a single GPU, with no population-level training.\n  Using 1{,}000 synthetic spatiotemporal intensity maps (kymographs) with controlled noise and artifacts, the framework reliably identifies degraded data and outputs appropriately inflated uncertainty estimates, showing strong correspondence between predictive uncertainty and error (Pearson $r = 0.997$, Spearman $ρ= 0.998$). Clinical validation in 12 patients shows strong agreement between PUNCH-derived CFR and invasive bolus thermodilution (Pearson $r = 0.90$, $p = 6.3 \\times 10^{-5}$).

IGFT combines online Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with information-theoretic rewards, enabling models to learn from self-generated conversations with simulated patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on expensive expert-annotated conversations or static datasets, our online RL framework allows models to discover effective questioning strategies through exploration. Our key innovation is an information gain reward function that tracks which clinical entities such as symptoms, temporal patterns, and medical history, are revealed during conversation. Each question's reward is computed based on its expected information gain combined with GPT-4o-mini quality assessments across dimensions including clinical relevance, patient engagement, and specificity. This hybrid approach ensures models learn to ask targeted, clinically appropriate questions that efficiently gather diagnostic information. We fine-tune two models using LoRA: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (a reasoning-optimized model).

We introduce $P^3$, an interactive framework for high-quality personalization without revealing private profiles to server-side LLMs. In $P^3$, a large server-side model generates a sequence of $k$ draft tokens based solely on the user query, while a small client-side model, with retrieval access to the user's private profile, evaluates and modifies these drafts to better reflect user preferences. This process repeats until an end token is generated. Experiments on LaMP-QA, a recent benchmark consisting of three personalized question answering datasets, show that $P^3$ consistently outperforms both non-personalized server-side and personalized client-side baselines, achieving statistically significant improvements of $7.4%$ to $9%$ on average. Importantly, $P^3$ recovers $90.3%$ to $95.7%$ of the utility of a ``leaky'' upper-bound scenario in which the full profile is exposed to the large server-side model. Privacy analyses, including linkability and attribute inference attacks, indicate that $P^3$ preserves the privacy of a non-personalized server-side model, introducing only marginal additional leakage ($1.5%$--$3.5%$) compared to submitting a query without any personal context. Additionally, the framework is efficient for edge deployment, with the client-side model generating only $9.2%$ of the total tokens.

SpecBridge fine-tunes a self-supervised spectral encoder (DreaMS) to project directly into the latent space of a frozen molecular foundation model (ChemBERTa), and then performs retrieval by cosine similarity to a fixed bank of precomputed molecular embeddings.

To study this phenomenon, we introduce PS-Bench, a benchmark designed to identify and quantify intent legitimation in personalized interactions. Across multiple memory-augmented agent frameworks and base LLMs, personalization increases attack success rates by 15.8%-243.7% relative to stateless baselines.

In contrast, sequence labeling (SL) tasks assign labels to each individual input token, naturally benefiting from bidirectional context. This discrepancy has historically led SL to rely on inherently bidirectional encoder-only models. However, the rapid development of decoder-only models has raised the question of whether they can be adapted to SL. While causal mask removal has emerged as a viable technique for adapting decoder-only models to leverage the full context for SL, it requires considerable changes to the base model functionality. In this work, we explore sequence repetition (SR) as a less invasive alternative for enabling bidirectionality in decoder-only models. Through fine-tuning experiments, we show that SR inherently makes decoders bidirectional, improving the quality of token-level embeddings and surpassing encoders and unmasked decoders. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that increasing the number of repetitions does not degrade SL performance. Finally, we demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers are highly effective for SR, comparable to those from final layers, while being significantly more efficient to compute. Our findings underscore that SR alleviates the structural limitations of decoders, enabling more efficient and adaptable LMs and broadening their applicability to other token-level tasks."}

The neural network produces candidate solution states that are advanced by the numerical solver, and training minimizes the discrepancy between the network prediction and the solver-evolved state. This pull-push interaction enables the network to learn physically admissible solutions through repeated exposure to the solver's action, without requiring problem-specific loss engineering or explicit evaluation of differential equation residuals.

While much prior work treats reasoning as a linear chain of steps, many reasoning problems are more naturally structured as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where intermediate conclusions may depend on multiple premises, branch into parallel sub-derivations, and later merge or be reused. Understanding whether such graph-structured reasoning is reflected in model internals remains an open question.\n  In this work, we introduce Reasoning DAG Probing, a framework that directly asks whether LLM hidden states encode the geometry of a reasoning DAG in a linearly accessible form, and where this structure emerges across layers. Within this framework, we associate each reasoning node with a textual realization and train lightweight probes to predict two graph-theoretic properties from hidden states: node depth and pairwise node distance. We use these probes to analyze the layerwise emergence of DAG structure and evaluate controls that disrupt reasoning-relevant structure while preserving superficial textual properties. Our results provide evidence that reasoning DAG geometry is meaningfully encoded in intermediate layers, with recoverability varying systematically by node depth and model scale, suggesting that LLM reasoning is not only sequential but exhibits measurable internal graph structure."}

The model processes variable-length sets of particle features without relying on input of explicit pairwise interactions, yet achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. On the large-scale JetClass dataset, a large-scale JetFormer matches the accuracy of the interaction-rich ParT model (within 0.7%) while using 37.4% fewer FLOPs, demonstrating its computational efficiency and strong generalization. On benchmark HLS4ML 150P datasets, JetFormer consistently outperforms existing models such as MLPs, Deep Sets, and Interaction Networks by 3-4% in accuracy. To bridge the gap to hardware deployment, we further introduce a hardware-aware optimization pipeline based on multi-objective hyperparameter search, yielding compact variants like JetFormer-tiny suitable for FPGA-based trigger systems with sub-microsecond latency requirements.

These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.\n  We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1."}

The Conditional Diffusion Model-based Inverse Problem Solver (CDI) has previously demonstrated effective probabilistic inference for one-dimensional temporal signals, but its applicability to higher-dimensional spatial data remains unexplored. We extend CDI to two-dimensional spatial conditioning, enabling probabilistic parameter inference directly from spatial observations. We validate this extension on convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) parameter inference - a challenging multi-parameter inverse problem in materials characterization where sample geometry, electronic structure, and thermal properties must be extracted from 2D diffraction patterns. Using simulated CBED data with ground-truth parameters, we demonstrate that CDI produces well-calibrated posterior distributions that accurately reflect measurement constraints: tight distributions for well-determined quantities and appropriately broad distributions for ambiguous parameters. In contrast, standard regression methods - while appearing accurate on aggregate metrics - mask this underlying uncertainty by predicting training set means for poorly constrained parameters. Our results confirm that CDI successfully extends from temporal to spatial domains, providing the genuine uncertainty information required for robust scientific inference."}

Rather than relying on generated text, we probe the model's confidence in opposing semantic directions (positive vs. negative impact) through carefully constructed sentences. By measuring how consistently the LLM favors one direction across diverse phrasings, we extract the strength and reliability of the model's belief about each feature's influence. We evaluate LoID on ten real-world tabular datasets under synthetic out-of-distribution (OOD) settings characterized by covariate shift, where the training data represents only a subset of the population. We compare our approach against (1) standard uninformative priors, (2) AutoElicit, a recent method that prompts LLMs to generate priors via text completions, (3) LLMProcesses, a method that uses LLMs to generate numerical predictions through in-context learning and (4) an oracle-style upper bound derived from fitting logistic regression on the full dataset.

The resulting agent decomposes control into five reusable skills: camera control, target lock-on, movement, dodging, and a heal-attack decision policy, each optimized for a narrow responsibility. This factorization improves sample efficiency by reducing the burden on any single policy and supports selective post-training: when the environment shifts from Phase 1 to Phase 2, only a subset of skills must be adapted, while upstream skills remain transferable.

Beyond this public impact lies a deeply personal toll on the friends and families of conspiracy believers, a dimension often overlooked in large-scale computational research. This study fills this gap by systematically mapping radicalization journeys and quantifying the associated emotional toll inflicted on loved ones. We use the prominent case of QAnon as a case study, analyzing 12747 narratives from the r/QAnonCasualties support community through a novel mixed-methods approach. First, we use topic modeling (BERTopic) to map the radicalization trajectories, identifying key pre-existing conditions, triggers, and post-radicalization characteristics. From this, we apply an LDA-based graphical model to uncover six recurring archetypes of QAnon adherents, which we term \"radicalization personas.\" Finally, using LLM-assisted emotion detection and regression modeling, we link these personas to the specific emotional toll reported by narrators. Our findings reveal that these personas are not just descriptive; they are powerful predictors of the specific emotional harms experienced by narrators. Radicalization perceived as a deliberate ideological choice is associated with narrator anger and disgust, while those marked by personal and cognitive collapse are linked to fear and sadness. This work provides the first empirical framework for understanding radicalization as a relational phenomenon, offering a vital roadmap for researchers and practitioners to navigate its interpersonal fallout."}

Across architectures under the same sweep, we observe qualitatively different response modes: sharp reorganization in Mistral, selective changes in Llama, and smooth trade-offs in Qwen. Critically, the DPO preference margin can anticorrelate with reasoning capability (Pearson $r=-0.91$ for Llama logic), so margin-based selection can prefer capability-impaired models.

The framework integrates multiple specialized agents for planning, external knowledge retrieval, critique, action generation, self-refinement, schema linking, and result validation, enabling iterative refinement of SQL predictions through agent collaboration.

However, existing ZO methods typically employ isotropic perturbations, neglecting the rich structural information available during the forward pass. In this paper, we identify a crucial link between gradient formation and activation structure: the gradient of a linear layer is confined to the subspace spanned by its input activations. Leveraging this insight, we propose Activation-Guided Zeroth-Order optimization (AGZO). Unlike prior methods, AGZO extracts a compact, activation-informed subspace on the fly during the forward pass and restricts perturbations to this low-rank subspace. We provide a theoretical framework showing that AGZO optimizes a subspace-smoothed objective and provably yields update directions with higher cosine similarity to the true gradient than isotropic baselines. Empirically, we evaluate AGZO on Qwen3 and Pangu models across various benchmarks. AGZO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ZO baselines and significantly narrows the performance gap with first-order fine-tuning, while maintaining almost the same peak memory footprint as other ZO methods."}

During training, the model first translates questions into the pivot language to facilitate better alignment of reasoning patterns. The reasoning process in the target language is then supervised by the pivot language's reasoning answers, thereby establishing a cross-lingual self-feedback mechanism without relying on external correct answers or reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances both the model's understanding of questions and its reasoning capabilities, leading to notable task improvements."}

The dual network generates trajectories towards the optimal multipliers across its layers while querying the primal network at each layer. Departing from standard unrolling, we induce DA dynamics by imposing primal-descent and dual-ascent constraints through constrained learning.

By demonstrating that experts rely on holistic risk heuristics rather than granular factor discrimination, these findings suggest that aggregated labels function as arithmetic compromises that effectively erase grounded professional philosophies. Our results characterize expert disagreement in safety-critical AI as a sociotechnical phenomenon where professional experience introduces sophisticated layers of principled divergence.

However, applying RL directly in high-dimensional, discrete token spaces faces three inherent challenges: sample-inefficient rollouts, high gradient estimation variance, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To fundamentally address these structural bottlenecks, we propose \\textbf{DeepLatent Reasoning (DLR)}, a latent-space bidirectional contrastive reinforcement learning framework. This framework shifts the trial-and-error cost from expensive token-level full sequence generation to the continuous latent manifold. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight assistant model to efficiently sample $K$ reasoning chain encodings within the latent space. These encodings are filtered via a dual reward mechanism based on correctness and formatting; only high-value latent trajectories are fed into a \\textbf{frozen main model} for single-pass decoding. To maximize reasoning diversity while maintaining coherence, we design a contrastive learning objective to enable directed exploration within the latent space. Since the main model parameters remain frozen during optimization, this method mathematically eliminates catastrophic forgetting. Experiments demonstrate that under comparable GPU computational budgets, DLR achieves more stable training convergence, supports longer-horizon reasoning chains, and facilitates the sustainable accumulation of reasoning capabilities, providing a viable path toward reliable and scalable reinforcement learning for LLMs."}

We evaluate the performance of DDR in experiments designed as a series of perturbations applied to sentences drawn from a sentence dataset.

However, existing GAD methods follow a \"one model per dataset\" paradigm, leading to high computational costs, substantial data demands, and poor generalization when transferred to new datasets. This calls for a foundation model that enables a \"one-for-all\" GAD solution capable of detecting anomalies across diverse graphs without retraining. Yet, achieving this is challenging due to the large structural and feature heterogeneity across domains. In this paper, we propose TFM4GAD, a simple yet effective framework that adapts tabular foundation models (TFMs) for graph anomaly detection. Our key insight is that the core challenges of foundation GAD, handling heterogeneous features, generalizing across domains, and operating with scarce labels, are the exact problems that modern TFMs are designed to solve via synthetic pre-training and powerful in-context learning. The primary challenge thus becomes structural: TFMs are agnostic to graph topology. TFM4GAD bridges this gap by \"flattening\" the graph, constructing an augmented feature table that enriches raw node features with Laplacian embeddings, local and global structural characteristics, and anomaly-sensitive neighborhood aggregations. This augmented table is processed by a TFM in a fully in-context regime. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with various TFM backbones reveal that TFM4GAD surprisingly achieves significant performance gains over specialized GAD models trained from scratch. Our work offers a new perspective and a practical paradigm for leveraging TFMs as powerful, generalist graph anomaly detectors."}

This paper outlines a new, decentralized multi-agent swarm (DMAS) architecture that includes autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents at each edge gateway, functioning as a distributed digital \"immune system\" for IIoT networks. Instead of using a traditional static firewall approach, the DMAS agents communicate via a lightweight peer-to-peer protocol to cooperatively detect anomalous behavior across the IIoT network without sending data to a cloud infrastructure. The authors also outline a consensus-based threat validation (CVT) process in which agents vote on the threat level of an identified threat, enabling instant quarantine of a compromised node or nodes. The authors conducted experiments on a testbed that simulated an innovative factory environment with 2000 IIoT devices and found that the DMAS demonstrated sub-millisecond response times (average of 0.85ms), 97.3% accuracy in detecting malicious activity under high load, and 87% accuracy in detecting zero-day attacks. All significantly higher than baseline values for both centralized and edge computing.

Methods include a time-optimal bang-bang baseline, a zero-shot Monte Carlo Tree Search planner, and a Proximal Policy Optimisation policy. We report total energy consumption in watt-hours under identical physical dynamics. Across sweeps of initial temperature from 10 to 30 degrees Celsius, deadline from 30 to 90 steps, and target temperature from 40 to 80 degrees Celsius, PPO achieves the most energy-efficient performance at a 60-step horizon of 2 hours, using 3.23 kilowatt-hours, compared to 4.37 to 10.45 kilowatt-hours for bang-bang control and 4.18 to 6.46 kilowatt-hours for MCTS. This corresponds to energy savings of 26 percent at 30 steps and 69 percent at 90 steps. In a representative trajectory with a 50 kg water mass, 20 degrees Celsius ambient temperature, and a 60 degrees Celsius target, PPO consumes 54 percent less energy than bang-bang control and 33 percent less than MCTS.

Prior work suggests that language models (LMs) exhibit limited inherent moral reasoning, leading to calls for explicit moral teaching. However, constructing ground truth data for moral evaluation is difficult given plural frameworks and pervasive biases. We investigate unsupervised elicitation as an alternative, asking whether pretrained (base) LMs possess intrinsic moral reasoning capability that can be surfaced without human supervision. Using the Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM) algorithm across three benchmark datasets and four LMs, we test whether ICM can reliably label moral judgments, generalize across moral frameworks, and mitigate social bias. Results show that ICM outperforms all pre-trained and chatbot baselines on the Norm Bank and ETHICS benchmarks, while fine-tuning on ICM labels performs on par with or surpasses those of human labels. Across theoretically motivated moral frameworks, ICM yields its largest relative gains on Justice and Commonsense morality. Furthermore, although chatbot LMs exhibit social bias failure rates comparable to their pretrained ones, ICM reduces such errors by more than half, with the largest improvements in race, socioeconomic status, and politics. These findings suggest that pretrained LMs possess latent moral reasoning capacities that can be elicited through unsupervised methods like ICM, providing a scalable path for AI alignment."}

Nevertheless, most existing methods do not fully utilize these edge weights. Leveraging edge weights in graph clustering tasks faces two critical challenges. (1) The introduction of edge weights may significantly increase storage space and training time, making it essential to reduce the graph scale while preserving nodes that are beneficial for the clustering task. (2) Edge weight information may inherently contain noise that negatively impacts clustering results. However, few studies can jointly optimize clustering and edge weights, which is crucial for mitigating the negative impact of noisy edges on clustering task. To address these challenges, we propose a contractile edge-weight-aware graph clustering network. Specifically, a cluster-oriented graph contraction module is designed to reduce the graph scale while preserving important nodes. An edge-weight-aware attention network is designed to identify and weaken noisy connections. In this way, we can more easily identify and mitigate the impact of noisy edges during the clustering process, thus enhancing clustering effectiveness. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world weighted graph datasets. In particular, our model outperforms the best baseline, demonstrating its superior performance.

To address this, we propose RouteMoA, an efficient mixture-of-agents framework with dynamic routing. It employs a lightweight scorer to perform initial screening by predicting coarse-grained performance from the query, narrowing candidates to a high-potential subset without inference. A mixture of judges then refines these scores through lightweight self- and cross-assessment based on existing model outputs, providing posterior correction without additional inference.

At the initial clinical encounters, physicians assess rare disease risk using only limited information under high uncertainty. When high-risk patients are not recognised at this stage, targeted diagnostic testing is often not initiated, resulting in missed diagnosis. Existing primary care triage processes are structurally insufficient to reliably identify patients with rare diseases at initial clinical presentation and universal screening is needed to reduce diagnostic delay. Here we present RareAlert, an early screening system which predict patient-level rare disease risk from routinely available primary-visit information. RareAlert integrates reasoning generated by ten LLMs, calibrates and weights these signals using machine learning, and distils the aligned reasoning into a single locally deployable model. To develop and evaluate RareAlert, we curated RareBench, a real-world dataset of 158,666 cases covering 33 Orphanet disease categories and more than 7,000 rare conditions, including both rare and non-rare presentations. The results showed that rare disease identification can be reconceptualised as a universal uncertainty resolution process applied to the general patient population. On an independent test set, RareAlert, a Qwen3-4B based model trained with calibrated reasoning signals, achieved an AUC of 0.917, outperforming the best machine learning ensemble and all evaluated LLMs, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, o3-mini, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen3-235B. These findings demonstrate the diversity in LLM medical reasoning and the effectiveness of aligning such reasoning in highly uncertain clinical tasks.

It enables large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning beyond text-chunk retrieval. Recent works have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to train agentic GraphRAG frameworks that perform iterative interactions between LLMs and knowledge graphs. However, existing RL-based frameworks such as Graph-R1 suffer from two key limitations: (1) they primarily depend on semantic similarity for retrieval, often overlooking the underlying graph structure, and (2) they rely on sparse, outcome-level rewards, failing to capture the quality of intermediate retrieval steps and their dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose ProGraph-R1, a progress-aware agentic framework for graph-based retrieval and multi-step reasoning. ProGraph-R1 introduces a structure-aware hypergraph retrieval mechanism that jointly considers semantic relevance and graph connectivity, encouraging coherent traversal along multi-hop reasoning paths. We also design a progress-based step-wise policy optimization, which provides dense learning signals by modulating advantages according to intermediate reasoning progress within a graph, rather than relying solely on final outcomes. Experiments on multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate that ProGraph-R1 consistently improves reasoning accuracy and generation quality over existing GraphRAG methods."}

To address this, we introduce DeepPlanning, a challenging benchmark for practical long-horizon agent planning. It features multi-day travel planning and multi-product shopping tasks that require proactive information acquisition, local constrained reasoning, and global constrained optimization. Evaluations on DeepPlanning show that even frontier agentic LLMs struggle with these problems, highlighting the importance of reliable explicit reasoning patterns and parallel tool use for achieving better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Error analysis further points to promising directions for improving agentic LLMs over long planning horizons. We open-source the code and data to support future research."}

We use several methods to extract gender-biased utterances, including lexicon-based mining, computational classification models, translation-based comparison analysis, and GPT-based bias creation. Our research indicates that the straight application of English-centric bias detection frameworks to Bengali is severely constrained by language disparities and socio-cultural factors that impact implicit biases. To tackle these difficulties, we executed two field investigations inside rural and low-income areas, gathering authentic insights on gender bias. The findings demonstrate that gender bias in Bengali presents distinct characteristics relative to English, requiring a more localized and context-sensitive methodology. Additionally, our research emphasizes the need of integrating community-driven research approaches to identify culturally relevant biases often neglected by automated systems. Our research enhances the ongoing discussion around gender bias in AI by illustrating the need to create linguistic tools specifically designed for underrepresented languages.

This principle appears under many names -- rejection sampling with SFT, goal-conditioned RL, Decision Transformers -- yet what optimization problem it solves, if any, has remained unclear. We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a $χ^2$ divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all. We apply our theory to the common practice of return thresholding, showing this can amplify improvement, but at the cost of potential misalignment with the true objective."}

In this paper, we propose a principled approach to disentangle and isolate task-specific parameter regions, motivated by the hypothesis that parameter heterogeneity underlies cross-task interference. Specifically, we first independently fine-tune LLMs on diverse SFT tasks and identify each task's core parameter region as the subset of parameters exhibiting the largest updates. Tasks with highly overlapping core parameter regions are merged for joint training, while disjoint tasks are organized into different stages. During multi-stage SFT, core parameters acquired in prior tasks are frozen, thereby preventing overwriting by subsequent tasks. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conducted intensive experiments on multiple public datasets. The results showed that our dynamic parameter isolation strategy consistently reduced data conflicts and achieved consistent performance improvements compared to multi-stage and multi-task tuning baselines."}

With this attention construction, we can explore how transformer architecture performance varies as a function of the attention scaling behavior controlled by $p$.

In the present study, we use this fact to generate texts with controllable reading ease. Our method employs a model that predicts human gaze patterns to steer language model outputs towards eliciting certain reading behaviors. We evaluate the approach in an eye-tracking experiment with native and non-native speakers of English. The results demonstrate that the method is effective at making the generated texts easier or harder to read, measured both in terms of reading times and perceived difficulty of the texts. A statistical analysis reveals that the changes in reading behavior are mostly due to features that affect lexical processing. Possible applications of our approach include text simplification for information accessibility and generation of personalized educational material for language learning."}

To address these limitations, we propose to exploit the embeddings from multiple pretrained language models and integrate them into $MCA^2$, a multi-view TAD framework. $MCA^2$ adopts a multi-view reconstruction model to effectively extract normal textual patterns from multiple embedding perspectives. To exploit inter-view complementarity, a contrastive collaboration module is designed to leverage and strengthen the interactions across different views.

We introduce Robust Privacy (RP), an inference-time privacy notion inspired by certified robustness: if a model's prediction is provably invariant within a radius-$R$ neighborhood around an input $x$ (e.g., under the $\\ell_2$ norm), then $x$ enjoys $R$-Robust Privacy, i.e., observing the prediction cannot distinguish $x$ from any input within distance $R$ of $x$. We further develop Attribute Privacy Enhancement (APE) to translate input-level invariance into an attribute-level privacy effect. In a controlled recommendation task where the decision depends primarily on a sensitive attribute, we show that RP expands the set of sensitive-attribute values compatible with a positive recommendation, expanding the inference interval accordingly. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that RP also mitigates model inversion attacks (MIAs) by masking fine-grained input-output dependence. Even at small noise levels ($σ=0.1$), RP reduces the attack success rate (ASR) from 73% to 4% with partial model performance degradation. RP can also partially mitigate MIAs (e.g., ASR drops to 44%) with no model performance degradation."}

In this work, we investigate the challenge of agentic post-training when the eventual test domains are unknown. Specifically, we analyze which properties of reinforcement learning (RL) environments and modeling choices have the greatest influence on out-of-domain performance. First, we identify two environment axes that strongly correlate with cross-domain generalization: (i) state information richness, i.e., the amount of information for the agent to process from the state, and (ii) planning complexity, estimated via goal reachability and trajectory length under a base policy. Notably, domain realism and text-level similarity are not the primary factors; for instance, the simple grid-world domain Sokoban leads to even stronger generalization in SciWorld than the more realistic ALFWorld. Motivated by these findings, we further show that increasing state information richness alone can already effectively improve cross-domain robustness. We propose a randomization technique, which is low-overhead and broadly applicable: add small amounts of distractive goal-irrelevant features to the state to make it richer without altering the task. Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization."}

This work systematically investigates two questions: how do TSFMs behave under standard sampling-based inference scaling, and can controlled sampling diversity enhance performance? We first examine the properties of TSFMs under standard sampling often fail to adhere to scaling laws due to insufficient exploration of the solution space. Building on this, we then delve into diversified inference scaling via tailored time series perturbations to expand the generative distribution's support. We theoretically analyze the diversity-fidelity trade-off and derive a critical sample threshold for diversified sampling to outperform standard sampling. Extensive experiments across various TSFMs and datasets show proper diversified inference scaling yields substantial performance gains without parameter updates, establishing inference design as a critical, compute-efficient dimension of TSFM optimization. As an application, we propose RobustMSE, a rigorous metric to quantify the headroom performance of TSFM under a fixed budget. Overall, our findings clarify these factor interactions, enabling reliable performance via diverse large-scale inference time series in parallel environments without re-training TSFMs."}

In this regime, classical energy-based diagnostics and unconstrained learned representations are structurally insensitive, leading to delayed or unstable detection. We introduce GO-OSC, a geometry-aware representation learning framework for oscillatory time series that enforces a canonical and identifiable latent parameterization, enabling stable comparison and aggregation across short, unlabeled windows. Building on this representation, we define a family of invariant linear geometric probes that target degradation-relevant directions in latent space. We provide theoretical results showing that under early phase-only degradation, energy-based statistics have zero first-order detection power, whereas geometric probes achieve strictly positive sensitivity. Our analysis characterizes when and why linear probing fails under non-identifiable representations and shows how canonicalization restores statistical detectability. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real vibration datasets validate the theory, demonstrating earlier detection, improved data efficiency, and robustness to operating condition changes."}

This approach treats sequential task interactions as a continuous stream of experience, enabling the system to distill short-term execution feedback into long-term, reusable capabilities without access to ground-truth labels. Within this framework, we identify tool evolution as the critical pathway for capability expansion, which provides verifiable, binary feedback signals. Within this framework, we develop Yunjue Agent, a system that iteratively synthesizes, optimizes, and reuses tools to navigate emerging challenges. To optimize evolutionary efficiency, we further introduce a Parallel Batch Evolution strategy. Empirical evaluations across five diverse benchmarks under a zero-start setting demonstrate significant performance gains over proprietary baselines. Additionally, complementary warm-start evaluations confirm that the accumulated general knowledge can be seamlessly transferred to novel domains. Finally, we propose a novel metric to monitor evolution convergence, serving as a function analogous to training loss in conventional optimization. We open-source our codebase, system traces, and evolved tools to facilitate future research in resilient, self-evolving intelligence."}

D-SENO combines dilated convolution (DC) blocks with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) modules to jointly capture wide receptive fields and dynamics alongside channel-wise attention, enabling both accurate and efficient PDE inference. Carefully chosen dilation rates allow the receptive field to focus on critical regions, effectively modeling long-range physical dependencies.

To address these limitations, we propose Think-Augmented Function Calling (TAFC), a novel framework that enhances function calling accuracy through explicit reasoning at both function and parameter levels. Our method introduces a universal \"think\" parameter augmentation that enables models to articulate their decision-making process, with dynamic optimization for parameter descriptions to improve reasoning quality. For complex parameters, TAFC automatically triggers granular reasoning based on complexity scoring, ensuring appropriate justification for critical decisions. Additionally, we propose reasoning-guided optimization to align generated reasoning with human expectations. TAFC requires no architectural modifications to existing LLMs while maintaining full API compatibility.

While LLMs are known to generate samples that approximate real-world distributions, whether their fine-grained sampling probabilities faithfully align with task requirements remains an open question. Through controlled distribution-sampling simulations, we uncover a striking dichotomy in LLM behavior, distinguishing two model types: D-models (e.g. Qwen-2.5), whose P_token exhibits large step-to-step variability and poor alignment with P_task; and E-models (e.g. Mistral-Small), whose P_token is more stable and better aligned with P_task. We further evaluate these two model types in downstream tasks such as code generation and recommendation, revealing systematic trade-offs between diversity and stability that shape task outcomes. Finally, we analyze the internal properties of both model families to probe their underlying mechanisms. These findings offer foundational insights into the probabilistic sampling behavior of LLMs and provide practical guidance on when to favor D- versus E-models.

To address this issue, this paper introduces Self-Manager, a parallel agent loop that enables asynchronous and concurrent execution. The main thread can create multiple subthreads, each with its own isolated context, and manage them iteratively through Thread Control Blocks, allowing for more focused and flexible parallel agent execution. To assess its effectiveness, we benchmark Self-Manager on DeepResearch Bench, where it consistently outperforms existing single-agent loop baselines across all metrics. Furthermore, we conduct extensive analytical experiments to demonstrate the necessity of Self-Manager's design choices, as well as its advantages in contextual capacity, efficiency, and generalization."}

Existing literature primarily assumes well-annotated training graphs, while the reliability of labels is not guaranteed in real-world scenarios. Recently, efforts have been made to address the problem of graph learning with label noise. However, existing methods often (i) struggle to distinguish between reliable and unreliable nodes, and (ii) overlook the relational information embedded in the graph topology. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel method, Dual-Standard Semantic Homogeneity with Dynamic Optimization (DREAM), for reliable, relation-informed optimization on graphs with label noise. Specifically, we design a relation-informed dynamic optimization framework that iteratively reevaluates the reliability of each labeled node in the graph during the optimization process according to the relation of the target node and other nodes. To measure this relation comprehensively, we propose a dual-standard selection strategy that selects a set of anchor nodes based on both node proximity and graph topology. Subsequently, we compute the semantic homogeneity between the target node and the anchor nodes, which serves as guidance for optimization. We also provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to justify the design of DREAM. Extensive experiments are performed on six graph datasets across various domains under three types of graph label noise against competing baselines, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DREAM."}

We conduct a systematic evaluation of open-source LLMs on both flat and nested NER tasks. We investigate several research questions including the performance gap between generative NER and traditional NER models, the impact of output formats, whether LLMs rely on memorization, and the preservation of general capabilities after fine-tuning. Through experiments across eight LLMs of varying scales and four standard NER datasets, we find that: (1) With parameter-efficient fine-tuning and structured formats like inline bracketed or XML, open-source LLMs achieve performance competitive with traditional encoder-based models and surpass closed-source LLMs like GPT-3; (2) The NER capability of LLMs stems from instruction-following and generative power, not mere memorization of entity-label pairs; and (3) Applying NER instruction tuning has minimal impact on general capabilities of LLMs, even improving performance on datasets like DROP due to enhanced entity understanding. These findings demonstrate that generative NER with LLMs is a promising, user-friendly alternative to traditional methods. We release the data and code at https://github.com/szu-tera/LLMs4NER."}

Although trajectories contain useful signals, directly using trace text or vanilla hidden states for detection is brittle: traces vary in form and detectors can overfit to superficial patterns rather than answer validity. We introduce Answer-agreement Representation Shaping (ARS), which learns detection-friendly trace-conditioned representations by explicitly encoding answer stability. ARS generates counterfactual answers through small latent interventions, specifically, perturbing the trace-boundary embedding, and labels each perturbation by whether the resulting answer agrees with the original. It then learns representations that bring answer-agreeing states together and separate answer-disagreeing ones, exposing latent instability indicative of hallucination risk. The shaped embeddings are plug-and-play with existing embedding-based detectors and require no human annotations during training. Experiments demonstrate that ARS consistently improves detection and achieves substantial gains over strong baselines."}

The vanilla LoRA is implemented with uniform ranks, and the recent literature have found that properly allocating ranks on the LLM backbones results in performance boosts. However, the previous rank allocation methods have limitations since they rely on inexplanable and unreliable importance measures for the LoRA ranks. To address the above issues, we propose the ShapLoRA framework. Inspired by the explanable attribution measure Shapley Value, we combine the sensitivity-based measures with the idea of coalitions in the collaborative games among LoRA ranks, and propose a more explainable importance measure called Shapley sensitivity. In addition, we optimize the workflow of the existing works by: (a) calculating Shapley sensitivity on a separate validation set; (b) Setting up the allocating-retraining procedures for fair comparisons. We have conducted experiments on various challenging tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that our ShapLoRA method can outperform the recent baselines with comparable tunable parameters.\\footnote{Codes and fine-tuned models will be open-sourced to facilitate future research."}

However, the presence of label noise in real scenarios poses a significant challenge in learning robust GNNs, and their effectiveness can be severely impacted when dealing with noisy labels on graphs, often stemming from annotation errors or inconsistencies. To address this, in this paper we propose a novel approach called ICGNN that harnesses the structure information of the graph to effectively alleviate the challenges posed by noisy labels. Specifically, we first design a novel noise indicator that measures the influence contradiction score (ICS) based on the graph diffusion matrix to quantify the credibility of nodes with clean labels, such that nodes with higher ICS values are more likely to be detected as having noisy labels. Then we leverage the Gaussian mixture model to precisely detect whether the label of a node is noisy or not. Additionally, we develop a soft strategy to combine the predictions from neighboring nodes on the graph to correct the detected noisy labels. At last, pseudo-labeling for abundant unlabeled nodes is incorporated to provide auxiliary supervision signals and guide the model optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the superiority of our proposed approach."}

In this paper, we demonstrate that expensive online reinforcement learning is not all you need to build powerful research agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully open-source suite designed for effective offline training. Our core contributions include DeepForge, a ready-to-use task synthesis framework that generates large-scale research queries without heavy preprocessing; and a curated collection of 66k QA pairs, 33k SFT trajectories, and 21k DPO pairs.

We evaluate CCKG on five countries with human judgments of cultural relevance, correctness, and path coherence. We find that the cultural knowledge graphs are better realized in English, even when the target culture is non-English (e.g., Chinese, Indonesian, Arabic), indicating uneven cultural encoding in current LLMs. Augmenting smaller LLMs with CCKG improves performance on cultural reasoning and story generation, with the largest gains from English chains. Our results show both the promise and limits of LLMs as cultural technologies and that chain-structured cultural knowledge is a practical substrate for culturally grounded NLP."}

DeepResearch (DR) models ground outputs in verifiable evidence from tools and perform strongly in general domains, but their direct transfer to medical field yields relatively limited gains.

Medical questions require evidence interpretation in a knowledge-intensive clinical context; while general DR models can retrieve information, they often lack clinical-context reasoning and thus \"find it but fail to use it,\" leaving performance limited by medical abilities. Moreover, in medical scenarios, blindly scaling tool-call can inject noisy context, derailing sensitive medical reasoning and prompting repetitive evidence-seeking along incorrect paths. Therefore, we propose DeepMed. For data, we deploy a multi-hop med-search QA synthesis method supporting the model to apply the DR paradigm in medical contexts. For training, we introduce a difficulty-aware turn-penalty to suppress excessive tool-call growth.

As a consequence, the learned model can concentrate probability mass on a limited subset of empirical modes, exhibiting systematic degeneration despite smooth loss convergence. We empirically validate this effect using a controlled feedback-based training framework that stabilizes internal generation statistics, observing consistent low-entropy outputs and repetitive behavior across architectures and random seeds.

When these systems fail, the problem is often not the language model itself, but that the nearest neighbors in the embedding space correspond to the wrong cases. Modern machine learning systems increasingly rely on fixed, high-dimensional embeddings produced by large pretrained models and sentence encoders. In real-world deployments, labels are scarce, domains shift over time, and retraining the base encoder is expensive or infeasible. As a result, downstream performance depends heavily on embedding geometry. Yet raw embeddings are often poorly aligned with the local neighborhood structure required by nearest-neighbor retrieval, similarity search, and lightweight classifiers that operate directly on embeddings. We propose PEARL (Prototype-Enhanced Aligned Representation Learning), a label-efficient approach that uses limited supervision to softly align embeddings toward class prototypes. The method reshapes local neighborhood geometry while preserving dimensionality and avoiding aggressive projection or collapse. Its aim is to bridge the gap between purely unsupervised post-processing, which offers limited and inconsistent gains, and fully supervised projections that require substantial labeled data.

One promising approach for improving LLM reasoning abilities involves translating problems into formal logic and using a logic solver. Although off-the-shelf logic solvers are in principle substantially more efficient than LLMs at logical reasoning, they assume that all relevant facts are provided in a question and are unable to deal with missing commonsense relations. In this work, we propose a novel method that uses feedback from the logic solver to augment a logic problem with commonsense relations provided by the LLM, in an iterative manner. This involves a search procedure through potential commonsense assumptions to maximize the chance of finding useful facts while keeping cost tractable. On a collection of pure-logical reasoning datasets, from which some commonsense information has been removed, our method consistently achieves considerable improvements over existing techniques, demonstrating the value in balancing neural and symbolic elements when working in human contexts."}

Since most data collected from edge devices are unlabeled, unsupervised Federated Clustering (FC) is becoming increasingly popular for exploring pattern knowledge from complex distributed data. However, due to the lack of label guidance, the common Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) issue of clients have greatly challenged FC by posing the following problems: How to fuse pattern knowledge (i.e., cluster distribution) from Non-IID clients; How are the cluster distributions among clients related; and How does this relationship connect with the global knowledge fusion? In this paper, a more tricky but overlooked phenomenon in Non-IID is revealed, which bottlenecks the clustering performance of the existing FC approaches. That is, different clients could fragment a cluster, and accordingly, a more generalized Non-IID concept, i.e., Non-ICD (Non-Independent Completely Distributed), is derived. To tackle the above FC challenges, a new framework named GOLD (Global Oriented Local Distribution Learning) is proposed. GOLD first finely explores the potential incomplete local cluster distributions of clients, then uploads the distribution summarization to the server for global fusion, and finally performs local cluster enhancement under the guidance of the global distribution. Extensive experiments, including significance tests, ablation studies, scalability evaluations, qualitative results, etc., have been conducted to show the superiority of GOLD."}

However, computing Shapley values exactly requires $2^d$ game evaluations for a model with $d$ features. Lundberg and Lee's KernelSHAP algorithm has emerged as a leading method for avoiding this exponential cost. KernelSHAP approximates Shapley values by approximating the game as a linear function, which is fit using a small number of game evaluations for random feature subsets.\n  In this work, we extend KernelSHAP by approximating the game via higher degree polynomials, which capture non-linear interactions between features. Our resulting PolySHAP method yields empirically better Shapley value estimates for various benchmark datasets, and we prove that these estimates are consistent.\n  Moreover, we connect our approach to paired sampling (antithetic sampling), a ubiquitous modification to KernelSHAP that improves empirical accuracy. We prove that paired sampling outputs exactly the same Shapley value approximations as second-order PolySHAP, without ever fitting a degree 2 polynomial. To the best of our knowledge, this finding provides the first strong theoretical justification for the excellent practical performance of the paired sampling heuristic."}

The method integrates input normalisation, structured prompting, constrained decoding, and strict rule-based validation under fixed experimental settings to ensure reproducibility. Evaluations on heterogeneous real-world address data show high field-level accuracy, strong schema adherence, and stable confidence calibration.

While the truth may be out there in observed trajectories, existing methods struggle to extract it without supervision. In this work, we propose Unsupervised Imitation Learning from Observation (UfO) that addresses all of these limitations. UfO learns a policy through a two-stage process, in which the agent first obtains an approximation of the teacher's true actions in the observed state transitions, and then refines the learned policy further by adjusting agent trajectories to closely align them with the teacher's. Experiments we conducted in five widely used environments show that UfO not only outperforms the teacher and all other ILfO methods but also displays the smallest standard deviation. This reduction in standard deviation indicates better generalisation in unseen scenarios."}

While the development of this behavior is well characterized, we still lack a unifying computational framework to explain its underlying neural representations. Here, we investigate whether and when phonemic, lexical, and syntactic representations emerge in the activations of artificial neural networks during their training. Our results show that both speech- and text-based models follow a sequence of learning stages: during training, their neural activations successively build subspaces, where the geometry of the neural activations represents phonemic, lexical, and syntactic structure. While this developmental trajectory qualitatively relates to children's, it is quantitatively different: These algorithms indeed require two to four orders of magnitude more data for these neural representations to emerge. Together, these results show conditions under which major stages of language acquisition spontaneously emerge, and hence delineate a promising path to understand the computations underpinning language acquisition."}

While LLMs offer potential for accessible emotional assistance, their reliability, therapeutic relevance, and alignment with human standards remain challenging to address. This paper introduces a human-grounded evaluation methodology designed to assess LLM generated responses in therapeutic dialogue. Our approach involved curating a dataset of 500 mental health conversations from datasets with real-world scenario questions and evaluating the responses generated by nine diverse LLMs, including closed source and open source models. More specifically, these responses were evaluated by two psychiatric trained experts, who independently rated each on a 5 point Likert scale across a comprehensive 6 attribute rubric. This rubric captures Cognitive Support and Affective Resonance, providing a multidimensional perspective on therapeutic quality. Our analysis reveals that LLMs provide strong cognitive reliability by producing safe, coherent, and clinically appropriate information, but they demonstrate unstable affective alignment. Although closed source models (e.g., GPT-4o) offer balanced therapeutic responses, open source models show greater variability and emotional flatness. We reveal a persistent cognitive-affective gap and highlight the need for failure aware, clinically grounded evaluation frameworks that prioritize relational sensitivity alongside informational accuracy in mental health oriented LLMs. We advocate for balanced evaluation protocols with human in the loop that center on therapeutic sensitivity and provide a framework to guide the responsible design and clinical oversight of mental health oriented conversational AI."}

Our experiments on multiple LLMs show that prepending random words/sentences unrelated to the prompt result in greater diversity in the outputs of LLMs. We believe that this promising result and the evaluation protocol opens up interesting avenues for future work, such as how infusing randomness into LLMs could be applied to other domains. Further, the evaluation protocol could also inspire research into benchmarking LLM diversity more systematically."}

Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \\textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so. These capabilities translate into state-of-the-art performance across challenging benchmarks, improving the 7B base model by +24.9\\% on average and surpassing strong proprietary systems such as GPT-5 on multiple tasks, including VSP and Jigsaw."}

To formalize this perspective, we model learning as a transport process in the space of probability distributions over model configurations and introduce an epistemic free-energy framework.\n  Within this framework, we define the free-energy drop as a bookkeeping quantity that records the total reduction of epistemic free energy along a learning trajectory. This reduction decomposes into a reversible component associated with potential improvement and an irreversible component corresponding to entropy production.\n  We then derive the Epistemic Speed Limit (ESL), a finite-time inequality that lower-bounds the minimal entropy production required by any learning process to realize a given distributional transformation.

To address this challenge, we introduce BrainDistill, a novel implantable motor decoding pipeline that integrates an implantable neural decoder (IND) with a task-specific knowledge distillation (TSKD) framework. Unlike standard feature distillation methods that attempt to preserve teacher representations in full, TSKD explicitly prioritizes features critical for decoding through supervised projection. Across multiple neural datasets, IND consistently outperforms prior neural decoders on motor decoding tasks, while its TSKD-distilled variant further surpasses alternative distillation methods in few-shot calibration settings.

In this work, we introduce Health-SCORE, a generalizable and scalable rubric-based training and evaluation framework that substantially reduces rubric development costs without sacrificing performance. We show that Health-SCORE provides two practical benefits beyond standalone evaluation: it can be used as a structured reward signal to guide reinforcement learning with safety-aware supervision, and it can be incorporated directly into prompts to improve response quality through in-context learning. Across open-ended healthcare tasks, Health-SCORE achieves evaluation quality comparable to human-created rubrics while significantly lowering development effort, making rubric-based evaluation and training more scalable."}

As such, it is imperative that decoding models are able to generalize across variations, such as recordings from different brain sites, distinct sessions, different types of behavior, and a variety of subjects. Current models can only partially address these challenges and warrant the development of pretrained neural transformer models capable to adapt and generalize. In this work, we propose RPNT - Robust Pretrained Neural Transformer, designed to achieve robust generalization through pretraining, which in turn enables effective finetuning given a downstream task. In particular, RPNT unique components include 1) Multidimensional rotary positional embedding (MRoPE) to aggregate experimental metadata such as site coordinates, session name and behavior types; 2) Context-based attention mechanism via convolution kernels operating on global attention to learn local temporal structures for handling non-stationarity of neural population activity; 3) Robust self-supervised learning (SSL) objective with uniform causal masking strategies and contrastive representations. We pretrained two separate versions of RPNT on distinct datasets a) Multi-session, multi-task, and multi-subject microelectrode benchmark; b) Multi-site recordings using high-density Neuropixel 1.0 probes. The datasets include recordings from the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and from the primary motor cortex (M1) regions of nonhuman primates (NHPs) as they performed reaching tasks. After pretraining, we evaluated the generalization of RPNT in cross-session, cross-type, cross-subject, and cross-site downstream behavior decoding tasks. Our results show that RPNT consistently achieves and surpasses the decoding performance of existing decoding models in all tasks."}

In this study, we present a novel, AI-assisted drug design approach to promote targeted degradation of Abeta-42 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), using E3 ligase-directed molecular glues. We systematically evaluated the ternary complex formation potential of Abeta-42 with three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and MDM2, through structure-based modeling, ADMET screening, and docking. We then developed a Ligase-Conditioned Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (LC-JT-VAE) to generate ligase-specific small molecules, incorporating protein sequence embeddings and torsional angle-aware molecular graphs. Our results demonstrate that this generative model can produce chemically valid, novel, and target-specific molecular glues capable of facilitating Abeta-42 degradation.

We introduce GLEN-Bench, the first comprehensive graph-language based benchmark for nutritional health assessment. We combine NHANES health records, FNDDS food composition data, and USDA food-access metrics to build a knowledge graph that links demographics, health conditions, dietary behaviors, poverty-related constraints, and nutrient needs. We test the benchmark using opioid use disorder, where models must detect subtle nutritional differences across disease stages.

We introduce Agora, a framework that reframes coordination as a decentralized market for uncertainty. Agora formalizes epistemic uncertainty into a structured, tradable asset (perceptual, semantic, inferential), and enforces profitability-driven trading among agents based on rational economic rules. A market-aware broker, extending Thompson Sampling, initiates collaboration and guides the system toward cost-efficient equilibria. Experiments on five multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, MMBench, MathVision, InfoVQA, CC-OCR) show that Agora outperforms strong VLMs and heuristic multi-agent strategies, e.g., achieving +8.5% accuracy over the best baseline on MMMU while reducing cost by over 3x. These results establish market-based coordination as a principled and scalable paradigm for building economically viable multi-agent visual intelligence systems."}

Leveraging SSH as a proxy for sea ice dynamics enables improved understanding of the feedback mechanisms driving polar climate change and global sea-level rise. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle with reliable treatment effect estimation in spatiotemporal settings due to unobserved confounders and the absence of physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose the Knowledge-Guided Causal Model Variational Autoencoder (KGCM-VAE) to quantify causal mechanisms between sea ice thickness and SSH. The proposed framework integrates a velocity modulation scheme in which smoothed velocity signals are dynamically amplified via a sigmoid function governed by SSH transitions to generate physically grounded causal treatments. In addition, the model incorporates Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to balance treated and control covariate distributions in the latent space, along with a causal adjacency-constrained decoder to ensure alignment with established physical structures. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world Arctic datasets demonstrate that KGCM-VAE achieves superior PEHE compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the approach, showing that the joint application of MMD and causal adjacency constraints yields a 1.88\\% reduction in estimation error."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce TSRBench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark designed to stress-test the full spectrum of time series reasoning capabilities. TSRBench features: i) a diverse set of 4125 problems from 14 domains, and is categorized into 4 major dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, Prediction, and Decision-Making. ii) 15 tasks from the 4 dimensions evaluating essential reasoning capabilities (e.g., numerical reasoning).

This gatekeeping creates a practical barrier for sovereign settings in which a regional- or national-scale institution or domain owner must retain control and understanding of model weights, training data, and deployment while operating under limited resources and strict transparency constraints. To this end, we identify two core requirements: (1) adoptability, the ability to transform a base model into a general-purpose assistant, and (2) sovereign capability, the ability to perform high-stakes, region-specific tasks (e.g., legal reasoning in local languages and cultural knowledge). We investigate whether these requirements can be achieved without scaling massive instruction corpora or relying on complex preference tuning pipelines and large-scale reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We present Typhoon S, a minimal and open post-training recipe that combines supervised fine-tuning, on-policy distillation, and small-scale RFT. Using Thai as a representative case study, we demonstrate that our approach transforms both sovereign-adapted and general-purpose base models into instruction-tuned models with strong general performance. We further show that small-scale RFT with InK-GRPO -- an extension of GRPO that augments the GRPO loss with a next-word prediction loss -- improves Thai legal reasoning and Thai-specific knowledge while preserving general capabilities. Our results suggest that a carefully designed post-training strategy can reduce the required scale of instruction data and computation, providing a practical path toward high-quality sovereign LLMs under academic-scale resources."}

Based on this finding, we design Kareus, a training system that pushes the time--energy tradeoff frontier by optimizing both aspects. Kareus decomposes the intractable joint optimization problem into local, partition-based subproblems. It then uses a multi-pass multi-objective optimization algorithm to find execution schedules that push the time--energy tradeoff frontier.

Yet current approaches struggle between small language models prone to hallucination and limited knowledge retention, and large cloud-based language models plagued by privacy risks and high inference costs. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChemCRAFT, a novel framework leveraging agentic reinforcement learning to decouple chemical reasoning from knowledge storage. Instead of forcing the model to memorize vast chemical data, our approach empowers the language model to interact with a sandbox for precise information retrieval. This externalization of knowledge allows a locally deployable small model to achieve superior performance with minimal inference costs. To enable small language models for agent-calling ability, we build an agentic trajectory construction pipeline and a comprehensive chemical-agent sandbox. Based on sandbox interactions, we constructed ChemToolDataset, the first large-scale chemical tool trajectory dataset. Simultaneously, we propose SMILES-GRPO to build a dense chemical reward function, promoting the model's ability to call chemical agents. Evaluations across diverse aspects of drug design show that ChemCRAFT outperforms current cloud-based LLMs in molecular structure analysis, molecular optimization, and synthesis pathway prediction, demonstrating that scientific reasoning is not solely an emergent ability of model scale, but a learnable policy of tool orchestration. This work establishes a cost-effective and privacy-preserving paradigm for AI-aided chemistry, opening new avenues for accelerating molecular discovery with locally deployable agents."}

However, current approaches largely depend on rigid supervised signals, such as ground-truth response in supervised fine-tuning or preference scores in reinforcement learning. Such reliance is fundamentally limited for modeling complex empathy, as there is no single \"correct\" response and a simple numerical score cannot fully capture the nuances of emotional expression or the appropriateness of empathetic behavior. To address these limitations, we sequentially introduce EmpathyEval, a descriptive natural-language-based evaluation model for assessing empathetic quality in spoken dialogues. Building upon EmpathyEval, we propose ReEmpathy, an end-to-end SLM that enhances empathetic dialogue through a novel Empathetic Self-Reflective Alternating Inference mechanism, which interleaves spoken response generation with free-form, empathy-related reflective reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReEmpathy substantially improves empathy-sensitive spoken dialogue by enabling reflective reasoning, offering a promising approach toward more emotionally intelligent and empathy-aware human-computer interactions."}

These models can act as surrogates for volume data, enabling efficient storage and on-demand reconstruction via model predictions. However, conventional deterministic INRs only provide value predictions without insights into the model's prediction uncertainty or the impact of inherent noisiness in the data. This limitation can lead to unreliable data interpretation and visualization due to prediction inaccuracies in the reconstructed volume. Identifying erroneous results extracted from model-predicted data may be infeasible, as raw data may be unavailable due to its large size. To address this challenge, we introduce REV-INR, Regularized Evidential Implicit Neural Representation, which learns to predict data values accurately along with the associated coordinate-level data uncertainty and model uncertainty using only a single forward pass of the trained REV-INR during inference. By comprehensively comparing and contrasting REV-INR with existing well-established deep uncertainty estimation methods, we show that REV-INR achieves the best volume reconstruction quality with robust data (aleatoric) and model (epistemic) uncertainty estimates using the fastest inference time. Consequently, we demonstrate that REV-INR facilitates assessment of the reliability and trustworthiness of the extracted isosurfaces and volume visualization results, enabling analyses to be solely driven by model-predicted data."}

To address these limitations, we propose U-Fold, a dynamic context-folding framework tailored to user-centric tasks. U-Fold retains the full user--agent dialogue and tool-call history but, at each turn, uses two core components to produce an intent-aware, evolving dialogue summary and a compact, task-relevant tool log. Extensive experiments on $τ$-bench, $τ^2$-bench, VitaBench, and harder context-inflated settings show that U-Fold consistently outperforms ReAct (achieving a 71.4% win rate in long-context settings) and prior folding baselines (with improvements of up to 27.0%), particularly on long, noisy, multi-turn tasks.

Existing approaches limit in fixed client selection and aggregation on cloud server, making the privacy-preserving extraction of client-specific information during local training challenging. To this end, we propose Client-Centric Adaptation federated learning (FedCCA), an algorithm that optimally utilizes client-specific knowledge to learn a unique model for each client through selective adaptation, aiming to alleviate the influence of data heterogeneity. Specifically, FedCCA employs dynamic client selection and adaptive aggregation based on the additional client-specific encoder. To enhance multi-source knowledge transfer, we adopt an attention-based global aggregation strategy. We conducted extensive experiments on diverse datasets to assess the efficacy of FedCCA.

While prior work has explored information-seeking behavior through word games, existing benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that provide both final and intermediate signals based on Information Gain (IG). Moreover, they rarely provide systematic comparisons between models that use chain-of-thought reasoning and those that do not. We propose a multi-turn dialogue framework that quantitatively measures how effectively LLMs gather information through yes/no questions in a hierarchical knowledge graph environment. Our framework employs a triad of interacting LLM agents that ask questions, answer them, and update the hypothesis space. We adopt IG as the main metric, grounded in Shannon entropy, to assess query effectiveness at each turn and cumulatively. We instantiate our framework in a geographical Guess My City game setting organized in a five-level taxonomy and evaluate multiple LLM variants under fully and partially observable conditions, with and without Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that, among the evaluated models, the ones with explicit reasoning capabilities achieve higher IG per turn and reach solutions in fewer steps, particularly in partially observable settings. Analysis of reasoning traces reveals that smaller models compensate for limited capacity through more aggressive exploration of candidate questions, while larger models exhibit higher assertiveness in selecting optimal queries, generating candidates with greater potential IG."}

Many recent pre-trained models have been reported to exhibit only slight changes in the angular distance between the input and output hidden state vectors in the middle Transformer layers, despite a disproportionately large ``jump'' in the angular distance occurring in or around the final Transformer layer. To characterize this, we first introduce a quantitative metric for the jump strength around the final layer, and then demonstrate its prevalence across many open-weight models, as well as its amplification throughout pre-training. Assuming such jumps indicate an undesirable property, we propose the jump-suppressing regularizer (JREG) which penalizes this jump during pre-training, thereby encouraging more balanced capability usage across the middle layers. Empirical evaluations of three model sizes of Llama-based models, trained with the proposed JREG method, reveal improved task performance compared to the baseline without altering the model architecture."}

Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with a single token stream, a single next-token objective, and a single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, a unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under a single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via a lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stability-creativity trade-offs via a finite-state decoding mechanism. Empirically, AR-Omni achieves strong quality across three modalities while remaining real-time, achieving a 0.88 real-time factor for speech generation."}

Existing post-training quantization methods typically use small, English-only calibration sets; however, their impact on multilingual models remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate eight calibration settings (five single-language and three multilingual mixes) on two quantizers (GPTQ, AWQ) on data from 10 languages. Our findings reveal a consistent trend: non-English and multilingual calibration sets significantly improve perplexity compared to English-only baselines. Specifically, we observe notable average perplexity gains across both quantizers on Llama3.1 8B and Qwen2.5 7B, with multilingual mixes achieving the largest overall reductions of up to 3.52 points in perplexity. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that tailoring calibration sets to the evaluation language yields the largest improvements for individual languages, underscoring the importance of linguistic alignment. We also identify specific failure cases where certain language-quantizer combinations degrade performance, which we trace to differences in activation range distributions across languages. These results highlight that static one-size-fits-all calibration is suboptimal and that tailoring calibration data, both in language and diversity, plays a crucial role in robustly quantizing multilingual LLMs."}

At the system level, this non-determinism arises from floating-point non-associativity combined with dynamic batching and GPU kernels whose reduction orders vary with batch size. A straightforward way to eliminate non-determinism is to disable dynamic batching during inference, but doing so severely degrades throughput. Another approach is to make kernels batch-invariant; however, this tightly couples determinism to kernel design, requiring new implementations. This coupling also imposes fixed runtime overheads, regardless of how much of the workload actually requires determinism.\n  Inspired by ideas from speculative decoding, we present LLM-42, a scheduling-based approach to enable determinism in LLM inference. Our key observation is that if a sequence is in a consistent state, the next emitted token is likely to be consistent even with dynamic batching. Moreover, most GPU kernels use shape-consistent reductions. Leveraging these insights, LLM-42 decodes tokens using a non-deterministic fast path and enforces determinism via a lightweight verify-rollback loop. The verifier replays candidate tokens under a fixed-shape reduction schedule, commits those that are guaranteed to be consistent across runs, and rolls back those violating determinism. LLM-42 mostly re-uses existing kernels unchanged and incurs overhead only in proportion to the traffic that requires determinism."}

We probe this phenomenon using Baba Is You, where physical laws are mutable text rules, enabling precise evaluation of models' ability to override learned priors when rules change. We quantatively observe that larger models can exhibit inverse scaling: they perform worse than smaller models when natural language reasoning requires suppressing pre-trained associations (e.g., accepting \"Lava is Safe\"). Our analysis attributes this to natural language encoding, which entangles descriptive semantics and logical rules, leading to persistent hallucinations of familiar physics despite explicit contradictory rules. Here we show that representing dynamics as executable code, rather than descriptive text, reverses this trend and enables effective prior inhibition. We introduce Code-Grounded Vistas (LCV), which fine-tunes models on counterfactual pairs and identifies states with contradictory rules, thereby forcing attention to logical constraints rather than visual semantics. This training-time approach outperforms expensive inference-time search methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that representation fundamentally determines whether scaling improves or impairs contextual reasoning.

This paper develops an operator-agnostic axiomatic framework for adaptive weighting in multi-teacher knowledge distillation across three complementary scales: token, task, and context. We formalize structural conditions under which adaptive weighting operators are well-defined, admit multiple non-equivalent implementations, and can be hierarchically composed via product-structure normalization. Within this framework, we establish existence and non-uniqueness of conforming operators, characterize convergence of gradient-based optimization under standard assumptions, analyze stability and perturbation robustness, and provide an abstract formulation of safety-constrained distillation. The results decouple theoretical guarantees from specific weighting formulas, enabling principled analysis of adaptive distillation methods under heterogeneity, distribution shift, and safety constraints."}

However, many real-world taxonomies introduce ambiguities, such as identical leaf names under similar parent nodes, which prevent language models (LMs) from learning clear decision boundaries. In this paper, we present TaxMorph, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to transform entire taxonomies through operations such as renaming, merging, splitting, and reordering. Unlike prior work, our method revises the full hierarchy to better match the semantics encoded by LMs. Experiments across three HTC benchmarks show that LLM-refined taxonomies consistently outperform human-curated ones in various settings up to +2.9pp. in F1. To better understand these improvements, we compare how well LMs can assign leaf nodes to parent nodes and vice versa across human-curated and LLM-refined taxonomies. We find that human-curated taxonomies lead to more easily separable clusters in embedding space. However, the LLM-refined taxonomies align more closely with the model's actual confusion patterns during classification. In other words, even though they are harder to separate, they better reflect the model's inductive biases. These findings suggest that LLM-guided refinement creates taxonomies that are more compatible with how models learn, improving HTC performance."}

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of TabPFN and its fine-tuned variants, assessing predictive performance, fairness, and robustness across varying dataset sizes and distributional shifts. Our results reveal that while TabPFN achieves stronger predictive accuracy compared to baselines and exhibits robustness to spurious correlations, improvements in fairness are moderate and inconsistent, particularly under missing-not-at-random (MNAR) covariate shifts.

This is often difficult because a language embeds many dynamic and varied properties in its syntax, pragmatics and phonology, which need to be captured and processed. The capacity of computers to process natural languages is increasing because NLP researchers are pushing its boundaries. But these research works focus more on well-resourced languages such as English, Japanese, German, French, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, etc. Over 95% of the world's 7000 languages are low-resourced for NLP, i.e. they have little or no data, tools, and techniques for NLP work.\n  In this thesis, we present an overview of diacritic ambiguity and a review of previous diacritic disambiguation approaches on other languages. Focusing on the Igbo language, we report the steps taken to develop a flexible framework for generating datasets for diacritic restoration. Three main approaches, the standard n-gram model, the classification models and the embedding models were proposed. The standard n-gram models use a sequence of previous words to the target stripped word as key predictors of the correct variants. For the classification models, a window of words on both sides of the target stripped word was used. The embedding models compare the similarity scores of the combined context word embeddings and the embeddings of each of the candidate variant vectors."}

UniPACT's core contribution is a structured prompting mechanism that converts numerical EHR data into semantically rich text. This textualized patient context is then fused with representations learned directly from raw ECG waveforms, enabling an LLM to reason over both modalities holistically. We evaluate UniPACT on the comprehensive MDS-ED benchmark, it achieves a state-of-the-art mean AUROC of 89.37% across a diverse set of prognostic tasks including diagnosis, deterioration, ICU admission, and mortality, outperforming specialized baselines.

We thus propose ThinkTwice, a sampling and selection framework in which the LLM generates multiple candidate templates for a given document, and a selection module chooses the most suitable one. We introduce both an unsupervised method that exploits agreement across generated outputs, and a supervised selection method using reward models trained on labeled DocIE data.

Forgetting and regularization are not heuristic add-ons but structural requirements for adaptive systems. Drawing on information theory, thermodynamics, and information geometry, we introduce the BEDS (Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures) framework, modeling learning as the evolution of compressed belief states under dissipation constraints.\n  A central contribution is the Conditional Optimality Theorem, showing that Fisher-Rao regularization measuring change via information divergence rather than Euclidean distance is the unique thermodynamically optimal regularization strategy, achieving minimal dissipation. Euclidean regularization is shown to be structurally suboptimal. The framework unifies existing methods (Ridge, SIGReg, EMA, SAC) as special cases of a single governing equation.\n  Within this view, overfitting corresponds to over-crystallization, while catastrophic forgetting reflects insufficient dissipation control. The framework distinguishes BEDS-crystallizable problems, where beliefs converge to stable equilibria, from BEDS-maintainable problems, which require continual adaptation. It extends naturally to continual and multi-agent systems, where viability, stability under adaptation and finite resources replaces asymptotic optimality as the primary criterion. Overall, this work reframes learning as maintaining viable belief states under dissipation constraints, providing a principled lens on forgetting, regularization, and stability."}

We fine tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct to learn ontology term identifier mappings from the Human Phenotype Ontology (800 pairs) and the Gene Ontology (400 training pairs), withholding 400 GO pairs to test generalization. Treating learning as a time to event process across 20 epochs, we used stochastic decoding to detect latent knowledge at baseline and Cox proportional hazards models to identify predictors of acquisition, generalization, and degradation. Baseline deterministic recall for HPO was 2.8%, rising to 71.9% after fine-tuning. Latent knowledge was the strongest predictor of faster fact acquisition (HR 2.6) and was associated with earlier, higher peak learning rates and faster convergence; identifier frequency and curated annotation counts had smaller effects. Generalization to withheld GO facts was uncommon (5.8%) but more likely when latent knowledge was present. Previously correct GO mappings degraded more often for withheld (unseen) terms than for trained (seen) terms, suggesting a protective effect of reinforcement during training. These results show that latent knowledge predicts both the speed of factual learning during fine-tuning and the limited generalization of unseen ontology facts, while resistance to degradation depends on whether facts are reinforced."}

Current approaches require either sharing sensitive transaction data or operating in isolation, leaving critical cross-chain laundering patterns undetected. We present FedGraph-VASP, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning framework that enables collaborative anti-money laundering (AML) without exposing raw user data. Our key contribution is a Boundary Embedding Exchange protocol that shares only compressed, non-invertible graph neural network representations of boundary accounts. These exchanges are secured using post-quantum cryptography, specifically the NIST-standardized Kyber-512 key encapsulation mechanism combined with AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption. Experiments on the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset with realistic Louvain partitioning show that FedGraph-VASP achieves an F1-score of 0.508, outperforming the state-of-the-art generative baseline FedSage+ (F1 = 0.453) by 12.1 percent on binary fraud detection. We further show robustness under low-connectivity settings where generative imputation degrades performance, while approaching centralized performance (F1 = 0.620) in high-connectivity regimes. We additionally evaluate generalization on an Ethereum fraud detection dataset, where FedGraph-VASP (F1 = 0.635) is less effective under sparse cross-silo connectivity, while FedSage+ excels (F1 = 0.855), outperforming even local training (F1 = 0.785). These results highlight a topology-dependent trade-off: embedding exchange benefits connected transaction graphs, whereas generative imputation can dominate in highly modular sparse graphs.

Prior approaches in prompting and representation engineering can provide coarse or single-attribute control, but systematic evaluation of multi-attribute settings remains limited. We introduce an evaluation framework for fine-grained controllability for both single- and dual-concept scenarios, focusing on linguistically distinct concept pairs (e.g., persuasiveness vs.~humor). Surprisingly, across multiple LLMs and generative tasks, we find that performance often drops in the dual-concept setting, even though the chosen concepts should in principle be separable. This reveals a fundamental limitation of naive prompting-based control: models struggle with compositionality even when concepts are intuitively independent. Our framework provides systematic evidence of this gap and offers a principled approach for measuring the ability of future methods for multi-concept control."}

The focus of this work is twofold: first, to compare the convergence properties of the network outputs under various scaling schemes as the network width and the number of training steps tend to infinity; and second, to provide precise control of the approximation error associated with each scaling regime. Previous work has shown convergence to ordinary differential equations with random initial conditions under inverse square root scaling in the network width. In this work, we shift the focus from convergence speed alone to a more comprehensive statistical characterization of the algorithm's output, with the goal of quantifying uncertainty in neural Actor Critic methods. Specifically, we study a general inverse polynomial scaling in the network width, with an exponent treated as a tunable hyperparameter taking values strictly between one half and one. We derive an asymptotic expansion of the network outputs, interpreted as statistical estimators, in order to clarify their structure. To leading order, we show that the variance decays as a power of the network width, with an exponent equal to one half minus the scaling parameter, implying improved statistical robustness as the scaling parameter approaches one. Numerical experiments support this behavior and further suggest faster convergence for this choice of scaling. Finally, our analysis yields concrete guidelines for selecting algorithmic hyperparameters, including learning rates and exploration rates, as functions of the network width and the scaling parameter, ensuring provably favorable statistical behavior."}

This approach typically uses a single demographic cue in isolation (e.g., a name or dialect) as a signal for group membership, implicitly assuming strong construct validity: that such cues are interchangeable operationalizations of the same underlying, demographically conditioned behavior. We test this assumption in realistic advice-seeking interactions, focusing on race and gender in a U.S. context. We find that cues intended to represent the same demographic group induce only partially overlapping changes in model behavior, while differentiation between groups within a given cue is weak and uneven. Consequently, estimated disparities are unstable, with both magnitude and direction varying across cues. We further show that these inconsistencies partly arise from variation in how strongly cues encode demographic attributes and from linguistic confounders that independently shape model behavior. Together, our findings suggest that demographic probing lacks construct validity: it does not yield a single, stable characterization of how LLMs condition on demographic information, which may reflect a misspecified or fragmented construct. We conclude by recommending the use of multiple, ecologically valid cues and explicit control of confounders to support more defensible claims about demographic effects in LLMs."}

We address this gap by introducing TensorLens, a novel formulation that captures the entire transformer as a single, input-dependent linear operator expressed through a high-order attention-interaction tensor. This tensor jointly encodes attention, FFNs, activations, normalizations, and residual connections, offering a theoretically coherent and expressive linear representation of the model's computation. TensorLens is theoretically grounded and our empirical validation shows that it yields richer representations than previous attention-aggregation methods. Our experiments demonstrate that the attention tensor can serve as a powerful foundation for developing tools aimed at interpretability and model understanding.

However, in realistic federated environments, data is often unpaired and fragmented across disjoint nodes; one node may hold sensor data, while another holds textual logs. These datasets are strictly private and share no common samples. Current federated learning (FL) methods fail in this regime, as they assume local clients possess aligned pairs or require sharing raw feature embeddings, which violates data sovereignty. We propose a novel framework to train a global multimodal transformer across decentralized nodes with disjoint modalities. We introduce a small public anchor set to align disjoint private manifolds. Using Gram matrices calculated from these public anchors, we enforce semantic alignment across modalities through centered kernel alignment without ever transmitting private samples, offering a mathematically superior privacy guarantee compared to prototype sharing. Further, we introduce a subspace-stabilized fine-tuning method to handle FL with huge transformer models. We strictly decouple domain-specific magnitude shifts from semantic direction, ensuring that nodes with varying sensor characteristics align geometrically to the global consensus. Lastly, we propose precision weighted averaging, where efficiently obtained uncertainty estimates are used to downweight uncertain nodes. This paper establishes the mathematical backbone for federated unpaired foundation models, enabling a global model to learn a unified representation of the world from fragmented, disjoint, and private data silos without requiring centralized storage or paired samples."}

Focusing on well-known image classification of increasing complexity, and across Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Vision Transformers, our initial results show that, despite architectural diversity, performance is largely invariant and learning dynamics consistently exhibit three regimes: unstable, learning, and overfitting. We further characterize the minimal learnable parameters required for stable learning, uncover distinct convergence and pruning phases, and quantify the effect of reduced numeric precision on trainable parameters. Aligning with intuition, the results confirm that deeper architectures are more resilient to pruning than shallower ones, with parameter redundancy as high as 60%, and quantization impacts models with fewer learnable parameters more severely and has a larger effect on harder image datasets. These findings provide actionable guidance for selecting compact, stable models under pruning and low-precision constraints in image classification."}

Accepted at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) succeeds in reasoning tasks (e.g., math and code) by checking the final verifiable answer (i.e., a verifiable dot signal). However, extending this paradigm to open-ended generation is challenging because there is no unambiguous ground truth. Relying on single-dot supervision often leads to inefficiency and reward hacking. To address these issues, we propose reinforcement learning with verifiable reference-based rewards (RLVRR). Instead of checking the final answer, RLVRR extracts an ordered linguistic signal from high-quality references (i.e, reward chain). Specifically, RLVRR decomposes rewards into two dimensions: content, which preserves deterministic core concepts (e.g., keywords), and style, which evaluates adherence to stylistic properties through LLM-based verification. In this way, RLVRR combines the exploratory strength of RL with the efficiency and reliability of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments on more than 10 benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models confirm the advantages of our approach. RLVRR (1) substantially outperforms SFT trained with ten times more data and advanced reward models, (2) unifies the training of structured reasoning and open-ended generation, and (3) generalizes more effectively while preserving output diversity. These results establish RLVRR as a principled and efficient path toward verifiable reinforcement learning for general-purpose LLM alignment.

With the rapid recent advance in soft and stretchable electronics for emerging human- and robot-interfacing applications, there is a surging need for high-performance dielectric elastomers. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop soft elastomers that simultaneously possess high dielectric constants (k, related to energy storage capacity) and low Young's moduli (E, related to mechanical flexibility). While some new elastomer designs have been reported in individual (mostly one-off) studies, almost no structured dataset is currently available for dielectric elastomers that systematically encompasses their molecular sequence, dielectric, and mechanical properties. Within this context, we curate a compact, high-quality dataset of acrylate-based dielectric elastomers, one of the most widely explored elastomer backbones due to its versatile chemistry and molecular design flexibility, by screening and aggregating experimental results from the literature over the past 10 years. Building on this dataset, we propose a multimodal learning framework that leverages large-scale pretrained polymer representations from graph- and sequence-based encoders. These pretrained embeddings transfer rich chemical and structural knowledge from vast polymer corpora, enabling accurate few-shot prediction of both dielectric and mechanical properties from molecular sequences. Our results represent a new paradigm for transferring knowledge from pretrained multimodal models to overcome severe data scarcity, which can be readily translated to other polymer backbones (e.g., silicones, urethanes) and thus accelerate data-efficient discovery of soft high-k dielectric elastomers.

We refer to these covert, goal-directed behaviours as hidden intentions, which may arise from training and optimisation artefacts, or be deliberately induced by an adversarial developer, yet remain difficult to detect in practice. We introduce a taxonomy of ten categories of hidden intentions, grounded in social science research and organised by intent, mechanism, context, and impact, shifting attention from surface-level behaviours to design-level strategies of influence. We show how hidden intentions can be easily induced in controlled models, providing both testbeds for evaluation and demonstrations of potential misuse. We systematically assess detection methods, including reasoning and non-reasoning LLM judges, and find that detection collapses in realistic open-world settings, particularly under low-prevalence conditions, where false positives overwhelm precision and false negatives conceal true risks. Stress tests on precision-prevalence and precision-FNR trade-offs reveal why auditing fails without vanishingly small false positive rates or strong priors on manipulation types. Finally, a qualitative case study shows that all ten categories manifest in deployed, state-of-the-art LLMs, emphasising the urgent need for robust frameworks. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of detectability failures of hidden intentions in LLMs under open-world settings, offering a foundation for understanding, inducing, and stress-testing such behaviours, and establishing a flexible taxonomy for anticipating evolving threats and informing governance."}

Prior work has employed so-called personas, sociodemographic user attributes conveyed to a model, to study bias in LLMs by relying on a single cue to prompt a persona, such as user names or explicit attribute mentions. This disregards LLM sensitivity to prompt variations (robustness) and the rarity of some cues in real interactions (external validity). We compare six commonly used persona cues across seven open and proprietary LLMs on four writing and advice tasks. While cues are overall highly correlated, they produce substantial variance in responses across personas. We therefore caution against claims from a single persona cue and recommend future personalization research to evaluate multiple externally valid cues."}

The advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer novel perspectives for personality detection tasks. Existing approaches enhance personality trait analysis by leveraging LLMs to extract semantic information from textual posts as prompts, followed by training classifiers for categorization. However, accurately classifying personality traits remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of human personality and subtle inter-trait distinctions. Moreover, prompt-based methods often exhibit excessive dependency on expert-crafted knowledge without autonomous pattern-learning capacity. To address these limitations, we view personality detection as a ranking task rather than a classification and propose a corresponding reinforcement learning training paradigm. First, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish personality trait ranking capabilities while enforcing standardized output formats, creating a robust initialization. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a specialized ranking-based reward function.

To isolate the effects of pruning, we align pruning calibration and post-pruning recovery data with each model's original training distribution, which we show yields more stable and reliable pruning behavior.

Our results reveal clear paradigm-dependent differences: depth pruning outperforms width pruning on classification tasks, while width pruning is more robust for generation and reasoning. Moreover, static pruning better preserves reasoning performance, whereas dynamic pruning excels on classification and generation but remains challenging for long-chain reasoning.

Instead of relying solely on the fixed data, MoReBRAC utilizes a dual-recurrent world model to synthesize high-fidelity transitions that augment the training manifold. To ensure the reliability of this synthetic data, we implement a hierarchical uncertainty pipeline integrating Variational Autoencoder (VAE) manifold detection, model sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. This multi-layered filtering process guarantees that only transitions residing within high-confidence regions of the learned dynamics are utilized. Our results on D4RL Gym-MuJoCo benchmarks reveal significant performance gains, particularly in ``random'' and ``suboptimal'' data regimes.

We argue that addressing these constraints requires a paradigm shift from fitting data to learn user preferences to learn the process of preference adaptation. To realize this, we propose Meta Reward Modeling (MRM), which reformulates personalized reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Specifically, we represent each user's reward model as a weighted combination of base reward functions, and optimize the initialization of these weights using a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)-style framework to support fast adaptation under limited feedback.

Given the large size of their training data sets, their tendency to memorize training data raises serious privacy and intellectual property concerns. A key threat is the membership inference attack (MIA), which aims to determine whether a given sample was included in the model's training set. Existing MIAs for LLMs rely primarily on output confidence scores or embedding-based features, but these signals are often brittle, leading to limited attack success. We introduce AttenMIA, a new MIA framework that exploits self-attention patterns inside the transformer model to infer membership. Attention controls the information flow within the transformer, exposing different patterns for memorization that can be used to identify members of the dataset. Our method uses information from attention heads across layers and combines them with perturbation-based divergence metrics to train an effective MIA classifier. Using extensive experiments on open-source models including LLaMA-2, Pythia, and Opt models, we show that attention-based features consistently outperform baselines, particularly under the important low-false-positive metric (e.g., achieving up to 0.996 ROC AUC & 87.9% TPR@1%FPR on the WikiMIA-32 benchmark with Llama2-13b). We show that attention signals generalize across datasets and architectures, and provide a layer- and head-level analysis of where membership leakage is most pronounced. We also show that using AttenMIA to replace other membership inference attacks in a data extraction framework results in training data extraction attacks that outperform the state of the art.

However, existing search frameworks still rely heavily on implicit natural language reasoning to determine search strategies and how to leverage retrieved information across reasoning steps. This reliance on implicit reasoning creates fundamental challenges for managing dependencies between sub-questions, efficiently reusing previously retrieved knowledge, and learning optimal search strategies through reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we propose Dep-Search, a dependency-aware search framework that advances beyond existing search frameworks by integrating structured reasoning, retrieval, and persistent memory through GRPO.

FP8 offers an attractive lever for accelerating RL by reducing compute cost and memory traffic during rollout, but applying FP8 in RL introduces unique engineering and algorithmic challenges: policy weights change every step (requiring repeated quantization and weight synchronization into the inference engine) and low-precision rollouts can deviate from the higher-precision policy assumed by the trainer, causing train-inference mismatch and potential instability. This report presents a practical FP8 rollout stack for LLM RL, implemented in the veRL ecosystem with support for common training backends (e.g., FSDP/Megatron-LM) and inference engines (e.g., vLLM/SGLang). We (i) enable FP8 W8A8 linear-layer rollout using blockwise FP8 quantization, (ii) extend FP8 to KV-cache to remove long-context memory bottlenecks via per-step QKV scale recalibration, and (iii) mitigate mismatch using importance-sampling-based rollout correction (token-level TIS/MIS variants).

However, current pretraining approaches either constrain inputs to fixed dimensions or isolate training by scale, limiting the generalization and scalability of wireless foundation models. In this paper, we propose HeterCSI, a channel-adaptive pretraining framework that reconciles training efficiency with robust cross-scenario generalization via a new understanding of gradient dynamics in heterogeneous CSI pretraining. Our key insight reveals that CSI scale heterogeneity primarily causes destructive gradient interference, while scenario diversity actually promotes constructive gradient alignment when properly managed. Specifically, we formulate heterogeneous CSI batch construction as a partitioning optimization problem that minimizes zero-padding overhead while preserving scenario diversity. To solve this, we develop a scale-aware adaptive batching strategy that aligns CSI samples of similar scales, and design a double-masking mechanism to isolate valid signals from padding artifacts. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that HeterCSI establishes a generalized foundation model without scenario-specific finetuning, achieving superior average performance over full-shot baselines. Compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot benchmark WiFo, it reduces NMSE by 7.19 dB, 4.08 dB, and 5.27 dB for CSI reconstruction, time-domain, and frequency-domain prediction, respectively.

The problem of phase retrieval has a rich history, with a variety of applications such as optics, crystallography, heteroscedastic regression, astrophysics, etc. A major consideration in algorithms for phase retrieval is robustness against measurement errors. In recent breakthroughs in algorithmic robust statistics, efficient algorithms have been developed for several parameter estimation tasks such as mean estimation, covariance estimation, robust principal component analysis (PCA), etc. in the presence of heavy-tailed noise and adversarial corruptions. In this paper, we study efficient algorithms for robust phase retrieval with heavy-tailed noise when a constant fraction of both the measurements $y_i$ and the sensing vectors $a_i$ may be arbitrarily adversarially corrupted. For this problem, Buna and Rebeschini (AISTATS 2025) very recently gave an exponential time algorithm with sample complexity $O(n \\log n)$. Their algorithm needs a robust spectral initialization, specifically, a robust estimate of the top eigenvector of a covariance matrix, which they deemed to be beyond known efficient algorithmic techniques (similar spectral initializations are a key ingredient of a large family of phase retrieval algorithms). In this work, we make a connection between robust spectral initialization and recent algorithmic advances in robust PCA, yielding the first polynomial-time algorithms for robust phase retrieval with both heavy-tailed noise and adversarial corruptions, in fact with near-linear (in $n$) sample complexity."}

In this work, we uncover a critical dichotomy in ER's behavior: while it induces positive backward transfer on robust, unstructured tasks (e.g., boosting performance on previous NLP classification tasks through repeated rehearsal), it causes severe negative transfer on fragile, structured domains like code generation (e.g., a significant relative drop in coding accuracy). This reveals that ER trades structural integrity for broad consolidation. To address this dilemma, we propose \\textbf{Orthogonal Subspace Wake-up (OSW)}. OSW identifies essential parameter subspaces of previous tasks via a brief \"wake-up\" phase and enforces orthogonal updates for new tasks, providing a mathematically grounded \"safety guarantee\" for established knowledge structures. Empirical results across a diverse four-task sequence demonstrate that OSW uniquely succeeds in preserving fragile coding abilities where Replay fails, while simultaneously maintaining high plasticity for novel tasks.

To achieve this, we develop an explicit kernel polynomial method to derive an universal approximation of continuous functions, which is characterized not only by the refined Totik-Ditzian-type modulus of continuity, but also by polytopical domain decomposition. Then, a ReLU network is constructed to approximate the kernel polynomial in each subdomain separately. Furthermore, we find that polytope decomposition makes our approximation more efficient and flexible than existing methods in many cases, especially near singular points of the objective function. Lastly, we extend our approach to analytic functions to reach a higher approximation rate."}

We formalize learned measurement functions as a distinct focus of evaluation and introduce measurement stability, a property capturing invariance of the measured quantity across admissible realizations of the learning process and across contexts. We show that standard evaluation criteria in machine learning, including generalization error, calibration, and robustness, do not guarantee measurement stability.

This study provides a comprehensive audit of structural gender bias within the Taiwan Credit Default dataset, specifically challenging the prevailing doctrine of \"fairness through blindness.\" Despite the removal of explicit protected attributes and the application of industry standard fairness interventions, our results demonstrate that gendered predictive signals remain deeply embedded within non-sensitive features. Utilizing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we identify that variables such as Marital Status, Age, and Credit Limit function as potent proxies for gender, allowing models to maintain discriminatory pathways while appearing statistically fair. To mathematically quantify this leakage, we employ an adversarial inverse modeling framework. Our findings reveal that the protected gender attribute can be reconstructed from purely non-sensitive financial features with an ROC AUC score of 0.65, demonstrating that traditional fairness audits are insufficient for detecting implicit structural bias. These results advocate for a shift from surface-level statistical parity toward causal-aware modeling and structural accountability in financial AI."}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a partial remedy by grounding predictions in external knowledge. However, conventional RAG depends on semantic similarity, introducing new spurious correlations. We propose Multimodal Causal Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a framework that integrates causal inference principles with multimodal retrieval. It retrieves clinically relevant exemplars and causal graphs from external sources, conditioning model reasoning on counterfactual and interventional evidence rather than correlations alone. Applied to radiology report generation, diagnosis prediction, and visual question answering, it improves factual accuracy, robustness to distribution shifts, and interpretability.

The dense-packed zone height is an important performance and safety indicator but it is often expensive and impractical to measure due to optical limitations. We propose to estimate phase heights using only inexpensive volume flow measurements. To this end, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is first pretrained on synthetic data and physics equations derived from a low-fidelity (approximate) mechanistic model to reduce the need for extensive experimental data. While the mechanistic model is used to generate synthetic training data, only volume balance equations are used in the PINN, since the integration of submodels describing droplet coalescence and sedimentation into the PINN would be computationally prohibitive. The pretrained PINN is then fine-tuned with scarce experimental data to capture the actual dynamics of the separator. We then employ the differentiable PINN as a predictive model in an Extended Kalman Filter inspired state estimation framework, enabling the phase heights to be tracked and updated from flow-rate measurements. We first test the two-stage trained PINN by forward simulation from a known initial state against the mechanistic model and a non-pretrained PINN. We then evaluate phase height estimation performance with the filter, comparing the two-stage trained PINN with a two-stage trained purely data-driven neural network. All model types are trained and evaluated using ensembles to account for model parameter uncertainty. In all evaluations, the two-stage trained PINN yields the most accurate phase-height estimates."}

In this paper, we explore model-level explanation techniques for deep graph learning models, aiming to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the models' overall decision-making processes and underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we address the problem of counterfactual explanations for deep graph learning models by introducing a generative model-level counterfactual explanation approach called GCFX, which is based on deep graph generation. This approach generates a set of high-quality counterfactual explanations that reflect the model's global predictive behavior by leveraging an enhanced deep graph generation framework and a global summarization algorithm. GCFX features an architecture that combines dual encoders, structure-aware taggers, and Message Passing Neural Network decoders, enabling it to accurately learn the true latent distribution of input data and generate high-quality, closely related counterfactual examples. Subsequently, a global counterfactual summarization algorithm selects the most representative and comprehensive explanations from numerous candidate counterfactuals, providing broad insights into the model's global predictive patterns. Experiments on a synthetic dataset and several real-world datasets demonstrate that GCFX outperforms existing methods in terms of counterfactual validity and coverage while maintaining low explanation costs, thereby offering crucial support for enhancing the practicality and trustworthiness of global counterfactual explanations."}

In this paper, we propose a novel loss-based method by introducing a transition-induced similar state. The transition-induced similar state is defined as the distribution of next states transitioned from the previous state. Since it utilizes only environmental feedback and actually collected data, it better captures system dynamics. Building upon this foundation, we introduce Action Smoothing by Aligning Actions with Predictions from Preceding States (ASAP), an action smoothing method that effectively mitigates action oscillations. ASAP enforces action smoothness by aligning the actions with those taken in transition-induced similar states and by penalizing second-order differences to suppress high-frequency oscillations. Experiments in Gymnasium and Isaac-Lab environments demonstrate that ASAP yields smoother control and improved policy performance over existing methods."}

Through systematic experiments across multiple model scales (109B to 400B total parameters) and task sequences, we identify three primary mechanisms driving forgetting: gradient interference in attention weights, representational drift in intermediate layers, and loss landscape flattening. We demonstrate that forgetting severity correlates strongly with task similarity (Pearson r = 0.87) and gradient alignment metrics. Our analysis reveals that approximately 15 to 23 percent of attention heads undergo severe disruption during fine-tuning, with lower layers showing greater susceptibility.

However, on-policy distillation typically requires a separate, often larger, teacher LLM and does not explicitly leverage ground-truth solutions available in reasoning datasets. Inspired by the intuition that a sufficiently capable LLM can rationalize external privileged reasoning traces and teach its weaker self (i.e., the version without access to privileged information), we introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), a framework where a single model acts as both teacher and student by conditioning on different contexts. The teacher policy conditions on privileged information (e.g., verified reasoning traces) while the student policy sees only the question; training minimizes the per-token divergence between these distributions over the student's own rollouts. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving 4-8x token efficiency compared to reinforcement learning methods such as GRPO and superior performance over off-policy distillation methods."}

While the necessity of addressing this phenomenon remains debated, particularly given its limited impact on instance-wise tasks (e.g., retrieval), we prove that its influence is instead strongly pronounced in group-level tasks (e.g., clustering).

Reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large reasoning models stall on datasets with low initial success rates, and thus little training signal. We investigate a fundamental question: Can a pretrained LLM leverage latent knowledge to generate an automated curriculum for problems it cannot solve? To explore this, we design SOAR: A self-improvement framework designed to surface these pedagogical signals through meta-RL. A teacher copy of the model proposes synthetic problems for a student copy, and is rewarded with its improvement on a small subset of hard problems. Critically, SOAR grounds the curriculum in measured student progress rather than intrinsic proxy rewards. Our study on the hardest subsets of mathematical benchmarks (0/128 success) reveals three core findings. First, we show that it is possible to realize bi-level meta-RL that unlocks learning under sparse, binary rewards by sharpening a latent capacity of pretrained models to generate useful stepping stones. Second, grounded rewards outperform intrinsic reward schemes used in prior LLM self-play, reliably avoiding the instability and diversity collapse modes they typically exhibit. Third, analyzing the generated questions reveals that structural quality and well-posedness are more critical for learning progress than solution correctness. Our results suggest that the ability to generate useful stepping stones does not require the preexisting ability to actually solve the hard problems, paving a principled path to escape reasoning plateaus without additional curated data."}

On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for driving improvement. We find that natural solutions to remedy this exploration problem from classical RL, such as entropy bonuses, more permissive clipping of the importance ratio, or direct optimization of pass@k objectives, do not resolve this issue and often destabilize optimization without improving solvability. A natural alternative is to leverage transfer from easier problems. However, we show that mixing easy and hard problems during RL training is counterproductive due to ray interference, where optimization focuses on already-solvable problems in a way that actively inhibits progress on harder ones. To address this challenge, we introduce Privileged On-Policy Exploration (POPE), an approach that leverages human- or other oracle solutions as privileged information to guide exploration on hard problems, unlike methods that use oracle solutions as training targets (e.g., off-policy RL methods or warmstarting from SFT). POPE augments hard problems with prefixes of oracle solutions, enabling RL to obtain non-zero rewards during guided rollouts. Crucially, the resulting behaviors transfer back to the original, unguided problems through a synergy between instruction-following and reasoning. Empirically, POPE expands the set of solvable problems and substantially improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks."}

Designing effective adaptation strategies is challenging due to the long-term, sequential nature of infrastructure investments, deep uncertainty, and complex cross-sector interactions. We propose a generic decision-support framework that couples an integrated assessment model (IAM) with reinforcement learning (RL) to learn adaptive, multi-decade investment pathways under uncertainty. The framework combines long-term climate projections (e.g., IPCC scenario pathways) with models that map projected extreme-weather drivers (e.g. rain) into hazard likelihoods (e.g. flooding), propagate hazards into urban infrastructure impacts (e.g. transport disruption), and value direct and indirect consequences for service performance and societal costs. Embedded in a reinforcement-learning loop, it learns adaptive climate adaptation policies that trade off investment and maintenance expenditures against avoided impacts. In collaboration with Copenhagen Municipality, we demonstrate the approach on pluvial flooding in the inner city for the horizon of 2024 to 2100. The learned strategies yield coordinated spatial-temporal pathways and improved robustness relative to conventional optimization baselines, namely inaction and random action, illustrating the framework's transferability to other hazards and cities."}

To bootstrap more efficient RL, we consider reusing old sampling FLOPs (from prior inference or RL training) in the form of off-policy traces. Standard off-policy methods supervise against off-policy data, causing instabilities during RL optimization. We introduce PrefixRL, where we condition on the prefix of successful off-policy traces and run on-policy RL to complete them, side-stepping off-policy instabilities. PrefixRL boosts the learning signal on hard problems by modulating the difficulty of the problem through the off-policy prefix length. We prove that the PrefixRL objective is not only consistent with the standard RL objective but also more sample efficient. Empirically, we discover back-generalization: training only on prefixed problems generalizes to out-of-distribution unprefixed performance, with learned strategies often differing from those in the prefix. In our experiments, we source the off-policy traces by rejection sampling with the base model, creating a self-improvement loop. On hard reasoning problems, PrefixRL reaches the same training reward 2x faster than the strongest baseline (SFT on off-policy data then RL), even after accounting for the compute spent on the initial rejection sampling, and increases the final reward by 3x. The gains transfer to held-out benchmarks, and PrefixRL is still effective when off-policy traces are derived from a different model family, validating its flexibility in practical settings."}

Standard approaches, such as GSEA, rely on predefined phenotypic labels and pairwise comparisons, which limits their applicability in unsupervised settings. Existing unsupervised extensions, including single-sample methods, provide pathway-level summaries but primarily capture linear relationships and do not explicitly model gene-pathway associations. More recently, deep learning models have been explored to capture non-linear transcriptomic structure. However, their interpretation has typically relied on generic explainable AI (XAI) techniques designed for feature-level attribution. As these methods are not designed for pathway-level interpretation in unsupervised transcriptomic analyses, their effectiveness in this setting remains limited.\n  Results: To bridge this gap, we introduce LaCoGSEA (Latent Correlation GSEA), an unsupervised framework that integrates deep representation learning with robust pathway statistics. LaCoGSEA employs an autoencoder to capture non-linear manifolds and proposes a global gene-latent correlation metric as a proxy for differential expression, generating dense gene rankings without prior labels. We demonstrate that LaCoGSEA offers three key advantages: (i) it achieves improved clustering performance in distinguishing cancer subtypes compared to existing unsupervised baselines; (ii) it recovers a broader range of biologically meaningful pathways at higher ranks compared with linear dimensionality reduction and gradient-based XAI methods; and (iii) it maintains high robustness and consistency across varying experimental protocols and dataset sizes.

Traditional surrogate-assisted optimization methods using deep learning can accelerate the design process but do not usually incorporate uncertainty quantification, leading to poorer optimization performance due to erroneous predictions in data-sparse regions. Here, we introduce and validate a fundamentally different paradigm of Physics-Informed Uncertainty, where the degree to which a model's prediction violates fundamental physical laws serves as a computationally-cheap and effective proxy for predictive uncertainty. By integrating physics-informed uncertainty into a multi-fidelity uncertainty-aware optimization workflow to design complex frequency-selective surfaces within the 20 - 30 GHz range, we increase the success rate of finding performant solutions from less than 10% to over 50%, while simultaneously reducing computational cost by an order of magnitude compared to the sole use of a high-fidelity solver. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating uncertainty quantification in machine-learning-driven inverse design for high-dimensional problems, and establish physics-informed uncertainty as a viable alternative to quantifying uncertainty in surrogate models for physical systems, thereby setting the stage for autonomous scientific discovery systems that can efficiently and robustly explore and evaluate candidate designs."}

Rather than resolving the bulk mixture into discrete cell-type fractions, TwinPurify instead learns continuous, high-dimensional tumor embeddings by leveraging adjacent-normal profiles within the same cohort as \"background\" guidance, enabling the disentanglement of tumor-specific signals without relying on any external reference.\n  Benchmarked against multiple large cancer cohorts across RNA-seq and microarray platforms, TwinPurify outperforms conventional representation learning baselines like auto-encoders in recovering tumor-intrinsic and immune signals. The purified embeddings improve molecular subtype and grade classification, enhance survival model concordance, and uncover biologically meaningful pathway activities compared to raw bulk profiles.

FaLW innovatively assesses the unlearning state of each sample by comparing its predictive probability to the distribution of unseen data from the same class. Based on this, it uses a forgetting-aware reweighting scheme, modulated by a balancing factor, to adaptively adjust the unlearning intensity for each sample.

Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, we study patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and compare three recurrent architectures: a vanilla LSTM, an attention-augmented LSTM, and a time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM). All models are trained both as embedding models and as direct end-to-end predictors. Embedding quality is evaluated via CKD stage clustering and in-ICU mortality prediction. The T-LSTM produces more structured embeddings, achieving a lower Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI = 9.91) and higher CKD stage classification accuracy (0.74) than the vanilla LSTM (DBI = 15.85, accuracy = 0.63) and attention-augmented LSTM (DBI = 20.72, accuracy = 0.67).

In contrast, mesh-free methods, which do not rely on the simulation mesh, typically incur higher errors. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce SMART, a neural surrogate model that predicts physical quantities at arbitrary query locations using only a point-cloud representation of the geometry, without requiring access to the simulation mesh. The geometry and simulation parameters are encoded into a shared latent space that captures both structural and parametric characteristics of the physical field. A physics decoder then attends to the encoder's intermediate latent representations to map spatial queries to physical quantities. Through this cross-layer interaction, the model jointly updates latent geometric features and the evolving physical field. Extensive experiments show that SMART is competitive with and often outperforms existing methods that rely on the simulation mesh as input, demonstrating its capabilities for industry-level simulations."}

Building on the variational inference framework of AmbientFlow, our approach incorporates data-driven Riemannian geometry induced by normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of manifold structure through pullback metrics and Riemannian Autoencoders. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that, under appropriate geometric regularization and measurement conditions, the learned model recovers the underlying data distribution up to a controllable error and yields a smooth, bi-Lipschitz manifold parametrization. We further show that the resulting smooth decoder can serve as a principled generative prior for inverse problems with recovery guarantees. We empirically validate our approach on low-dimensional synthetic manifolds and on MNIST."}

IoT devices often operate under limited computational resources, lack robust physical safeguards, and are deployed in heterogeneous and dynamic networks, making them prime targets for cyberattacks and malware applications. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to automated malware detection and classification, but practical deployment requires models that are both effective and lightweight. The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of four supervised learning models (Random Forest, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron) for malware detection and classification using the IoT-23 dataset. We evaluate model performance in both binary and multiclass classification tasks, assess sensitivity to training data volume, and analyze temporal robustness to simulate deployment in evolving threat landscapes. Our results show that tree-based models achieve high accuracy and generalization, even with limited training data, while performance deteriorates over time as malware diversity increases. These findings underscore the importance of adaptive, resource-efficient ML models for securing IoT systems in real-world environments."}

Corresponding author: Maryam Abdolali (maryam.abdolali@kntu.ac.ir)", "summary": "Preference-based reinforcement learning (PBRL) offers a promising alternative to explicit reward engineering by learning from pairwise trajectory comparisons. However, real-world preference data often comes from heterogeneous annotators with varying reliability; some accurate, some noisy, and some systematically adversarial. Existing PBRL methods either treat all feedback equally or attempt to filter out unreliable sources, but both approaches fail when faced with adversarial annotators who systematically provide incorrect preferences. We introduce TriTrust-PBRL (TTP), a unified framework that jointly learns a shared reward model and expert-specific trust parameters from multi-expert preference feedback. The key insight is that trust parameters naturally evolve during gradient-based optimization to be positive (trust), near zero (ignore), or negative (flip), enabling the model to automatically invert adversarial preferences and recover useful signal rather than merely discarding corrupted feedback. We provide theoretical analysis establishing identifiability guarantees and detailed gradient analysis that explains how expert separation emerges naturally during training without explicit supervision. Empirically, we evaluate TTP on four diverse domains spanning manipulation tasks (MetaWorld) and locomotion (DM Control) under various corruption scenarios. TTP achieves state-of-the-art robustness, maintaining near-oracle performance under adversarial corruption while standard PBRL methods fail catastrophically. Notably, TTP outperforms existing baselines by successfully learning from mixed expert pools containing both reliable and adversarial annotators, all while requiring no expert features beyond identification indices and integrating seamlessly with existing PBRL pipelines."}

These failures typically stem from two sources: data-driven hallucinations and reasoning-driven hallucinations. However, existing detection methods usually address only one source and rely on task-specific heuristics, limiting their generalization to complex scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Hallucination Risk Bound, a unified theoretical framework that formally decomposes hallucination risk into data-driven and reasoning-driven components, linked respectively to training-time mismatches and inference-time instabilities. This provides a principled foundation for analyzing how hallucinations emerge and evolve. Building on this foundation, we introduce HalluGuard, an NTK-based score that leverages the induced geometry and captured representations of the NTK to jointly identify data-driven and reasoning-driven hallucinations. We evaluate HalluGuard on 10 diverse benchmarks, 11 competitive baselines, and 9 popular LLM backbones, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in detecting diverse forms of LLM hallucinations."}

A central difficulty is that conventional scalar reward formulations, obtained by aggregating these competing objectives, often obscure the structure of their trade-offs. We present a Proximal Policy Optimization based multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that learns a continuous set of policies explicitly representing these trade-offs and evaluates it on a scalable simulation platform for tactical decision making in trucks. The proposed approach learns a continuous set of Pareto-optimal policies that capture the trade-offs among three conflicting objectives: safety, quantified in terms of collisions and successful completion; energy efficiency and time efficiency, quantified using energy cost and driver cost, respectively. The resulting Pareto frontier is smooth and interpretable, enabling flexibility in choosing driving behavior along different conflicting objectives. This framework allows seamless transitions between different driving policies without retraining, yielding a robust and adaptive decision-making strategy for autonomous trucking applications."}
