This has further resulted in universities integrating\nprogramming courses into a wide range of curricula, including not only\ntechnical studies but also business and management fields of study.\n  Consequently, additional resources are needed for teaching, grading, and\ntutoring students with diverse educational backgrounds and skills. As part of\nthis, Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) have emerged, providing\nscalable and high-quality assessment systems with efficient evaluation and\ninstant feedback.

Although the\nresource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of\nproject management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader\nliterature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its\nintegration into the design and management of complex systems. The original\ncontribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the\nRCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems\nengineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT). A concrete translation\npipeline from an activity-on-node network to a SysML activity diagram, and then\nto an operand net is constructed. Using this representation, it specializes the\nhetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation to the RCPSP\ncontext as a systematic means of HFGT for quantitative analysis and proves that\nthe RCPSP is recoverable as a special case of a broader model. Secondly, on an\nillustrative instance with renewable and non-renewable operands, the\nspecialized HFNMCF, while producing similar schedules, yields explicit\nexplanations of the project states that enable richer monitoring and control.\nOverall, the framework preserves the strengths of the classical RCPSP while\naccommodating real-world constraints and enterprise-level decision processes\nencountered in large, complex megaprojects."}

The former,\nsuch as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream\ntasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational\ncapacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained\nadaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen\nsubset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and\neffective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory\nconsumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT\nmethod that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory\nefficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,\nconnections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces\nbypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the\nbypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.\nEmpirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and\nunderstanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance\nwith as little as $\\leq \\textbf{0.02}\\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing\nCUDA memory usage by up to 60%.

While the term root cause analysis or RCA has been\nwidely used, different studies formulate the task differently. This is because\nthe term \"RCA\" implicitly covers tasks with distinct underlying goals. For\ninstance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is\nfundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug for a\ndefinitive fix. However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these\ngoal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types\n(e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods). This leads to the grouping of\nworks with disparate objectives, thereby obscuring the true progress and gaps\nin the field. Meanwhile, the typical audience of an RCA survey is either laymen\nwho want to know the goals and big picture of the task or RCA researchers who\nwant to figure out past research under the same task formulation. Thus, an RCA\nsurvey that organizes the related papers according to their goals is in high\ndemand. To this end, this paper presents a goal-driven framework that\neffectively categorizes and integrates 135 papers on RCA in the context of\ncloud incident management based on their diverse goals, spanning the period\nfrom 2014 to 2025.

The extent to\nwhich such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,\ndependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,\nthe recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities\nhighly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to\nunderstanding information diffusion processes and to improving the\neffectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these\nprobabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations\nbetween peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence\nrelationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from\ninterventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or\noptimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher\ninfluence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence\nprobabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework.

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health\nmonitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute\nSpearman's $\\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with\nan absolute Spearman's $\\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed\nmethod can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the\n`age' of the system."}

We refer to this as the squeezing effect,\nwhich explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem\nfurther obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport\nactual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that\nexplicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence\ngenerations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture\nthe very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,\nincorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the\nsqueezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model\nbeliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S\n(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more\nthorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our\napproach."}

Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower\ndivergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges\ncan reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function\nto amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological\ncoupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge\nis quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a\ntopological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive\ninformation loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while\nmaintaining the model's utility.

In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks\n(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the\nIntegrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and\nenergy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate\n(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively\napplies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and\nre-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed\nstorage of different bitwidths.

As a result, information that\nlarge language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by\nhumans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced\ninformation: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order\nto decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find\nthat LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as\nclosely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from\nvigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that\nboosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the\ncorrespondence between LLMs and the rational model.

This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are\ncapable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was\ncreated to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning\n(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,\nexperimentation, and prototyping.\n  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference\nlatency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the\ninference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and\ncheckpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa\nmodels, with the intention of extending future work to include models of\ndifferent modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's\ncapabilities.

For such prediction the paper poses world\nmodeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in\nfuture frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the\nsame tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can\nbe trained as \"semantic\" world models through a supervised finetuning process\non image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while\ninheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the\npretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic\nworld model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,\nleading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of\nreconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling.

However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the\n''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their\ncurrent capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent\nzero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses\nthe advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible\nto the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce\nScaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive\ntraining framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a\nmodel's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses\nlearning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,\nranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to\nconstruct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging\nmathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the\npass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative\n44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework\nprovides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to\nsolve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending\nthe frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM."}

Hubble models come in standard\nand perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English\ncorpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled\ninsertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to\nemulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard\nand perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B\ntokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency\nof sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password\nappearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password\nin a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text\ninserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without\ncontinued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices\nfor addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the\nsize of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in\ntraining. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range\nof memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how\nreadily different types of private information are memorized. We also\ndemonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed\nfor membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to\nfurther explore, benchmark, and build upon our work."}
